  The Full Journey — Objective Systems Analysis

  What Distributo is: An AI system that takes a founder's description of their
  ideal customer, finds real people on the internet who match that profile, and
  delivers them as leads.

  Architecture (v2, built across CCI76-91): Orchestrator → 3 sub-agents:
  - Comprehension — Turns founder interview into structured ICP (communities,
  language patterns, false positives)
  - Search — Finds candidates across Reddit, LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube
  - Eval — Judges each candidate: is this actually the founder's customer?

  The journey across 30+ sessions:
  Phase: Architecture
  Sessions: CCI71-77
  What happened: Redesigned from monolith to orchestrator + 3 agents
  Result: Good design, 40 tasks
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Phase: Implementation
  Sessions: CCI80-84
  What happened: Built v2, but 0 matches (v1 got 5-10)
  Result: Product broken
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Phase: Eval fixes
  Sessions: CCI88-91
  What happened: Reduced rejection categories 8→3, added batching, fixed
    comprehension
  Result: Pre-built ICP: 16 matches, 90% precision
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Phase: Search fixes
  Sessions: CCI93-99
  What happened: Identity queries, platform switching, TikTok/YouTube
  Result: Improved but unstable
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Phase: Validation
  Sessions: CCI100-103
  What happened: Analyzed 180 August rejections — all correct. Problem is
  search,
     not eval
  Result: Diagnosis confirmed
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Phase: Execution
  Sessions: CCI104-106
  What happened: 3 concurrent sessions fixing search + feedback loops
  Result: August: 11 matches, Scaylor: 13 matches
  The proof point: Pre-built ICP test (CCI80/88) → 16 matches at 90% precision.
  When comprehension produces a rich ICP, the whole pipeline works.

  Current state on disk:
  - August: 11 matches, $1.09, ~60% strict precision
  - Scaylor: 13 matches, $2.40, ~62% strict precision
  - 3 concurrent sessions edited orchestrator.py — C's changes won (more
  comprehensive), B's feedback text was partially overwritten
  - Confidence field added to eval but not yet tested end-to-end

  What you told the agents:
  1. "distributo has to find out by itself if the founder is wrong" — stop
  hand-fixing ICPs
  2. "60% precision is not a success" — you need 90%+
  3. "keep the generous leads but classify them" — confidence tiers
  (high/medium), not binary match/reject
  4. "there's no end to high intent, it's distributo's fault" — the internet has
   enough people, search queries are wrong

  The 3 open problems:
  1. Precision is 60%, needs to be 90%+ — Eval can't distinguish practitioners
  from consultants on thin snippets. Needs enrichment (full LinkedIn profile,
  post history) before judging.
  2. Search still misses people — Only 1 cycle, only ~200-370 candidates. The
  internet has thousands of field sales managers posting right now. Query
  diversity and platform coverage are still weak.
  3. No self-correction — When r/outsideSales 404s, search should pivot
  automatically. When all candidates from a community get rejected, search
  should stop looking there. The feedback loops exist in code but aren't proven.

  ---
  Rewritten prompt:

  Fix Distributo's matching pipeline to hit 90%+ strict precision. The current 
  state: August gets 11 matches at 60% precision ($1.09), Scaylor gets 13 at 62%
   ($2.40). The gap is that eval sees thin snippets and can't tell practitioners
   from consultants — 4 of 10 August matches are "borderline" (probably 
  consultants writing ABOUT field sales, not doing it). Three things need to 
  happen:

  1. Enrichment before eval — Before eval judges a candidate, fetch their full 
  context: LinkedIn title/headline, recent post history, profile bio. 
  orchestrator.py has a _enrich_candidates method (rewritten by session C) but 
  it's untested. Wire it up so eval gets rich context, not just one snippet. 
  Don't over-engineer — a Serper search for their username + platform is enough.
  2. Confidence tiers in output — Eval now has confidence: high|medium (added in
   CCI104 session C to eval.py:56-61 and icp_profile.py:21). Run both August and
   Scaylor end-to-end and verify: (a) confidence field actually appears in 
  results, (b) 90%+ of matches are "high" confidence, (c) "medium" matches are 
  clearly labeled so the founder knows to check the profile.
  3. Measure honestly — After the run, audit every match yourself. For each one:
   read what eval saw, check if the person is actually the ICP or a 
  consultant/coach/vendor. Report strict precision (high-confidence only) and 
  total precision (high + medium). Target: 90%+ strict.

  Don't touch search queries — search is finding enough candidates now (200-370 
  per run). Don't touch comprehension. Don't change recency. The fix is between 
  search and eval: give eval better data to judge with.

  Files: matching_layer/orchestrator.py (enrichment wiring), 
  matching_layer/agents/eval.py (confidence prompt), 
  matching_layer/icp_profile.py (Match dataclass), test_august_fixed.py and 
  test_scay_full.py (test runners that need to serialize confidence).

  Run August first, audit, then Scaylor. Report precision for each.

  - I'm interpreting "figure this out fully" as: synthesize the full history,
  identify the real blocker (enrichment before eval), and execute the fix — not
  just analyze
  - The 3 concurrent sessions created merge conflicts in orchestrator.py — I'll
  resolve those before running

  What Each Session Did

  CCI103 — Rewrote eval to semantic/totality matching. Added compound learning.
  Updated Scaylor founder answers. Hit context limit before testing.

  CCI104 — Three concurrent sessions:
  - Session B (95e16684): Rewrote search prompt (identity-based), added failed
  community tracking, subreddit validation, reverted hand-fixed ICP per your
  feedback
  - Session C (c6914897): Fixed orchestrator feedback loops, enrichment rewrite,
   LinkedIn title parsing, reasoning model refinement, founder approval gate.
  Won the conflict on orchestrator.py. Ran August (11 matches, $1.09) and
  Scaylor (13 matches, $2.40)
  - Session "Coordinator" (88e0a838): Extracted benchmark data, read sessions,
  detected conflicts

  CCI105 — Ran CCI103's untested changes. August still 0 Reddit matches across
  all cycles. Diagnosed: r/sales is 95% SaaS/inside sales, LinkedIn returns job
  postings not people's posts, TikTok actually works but under-utilized. Added
  platform-specific query rules. Built mechanical multi-platform search in
  orchestrator. Hit context limit at "WHY ARE YOU ONLY LOOKING AT ONE
  SUBREDDIT."

  CCI106 — Read all sessions, detected orchestrator.py conflicts between B and
  C. Analyzed the 782-line diff. Confirmed C's version won.

  The 5 Core Problems (Still Open)

  1. Precision is ~60%, needs 90%+. Eval sees thin snippets and can't
  distinguish practitioners from consultants. 4 of 10 matches are "borderline."
  Confidence tiers were added to eval.py and icp_profile.py but never tested
  end-to-end.
  2. Reddit search is fundamentally broken for field sales. r/sales is 95%
  SaaS/inside sales. Queries like "field sales reps" return CRM admins and SaaS
  founders. Search agent spends 50% of tool calls on Reddit getting 0 matches.
  Industry subreddits (r/hvac, r/roofing, r/manufacturing) are where field
  workers actually are, but search agent ignores this guidance.
  3. Search agent doesn't diversify platforms. Despite prompting, it spends
  22/45 tool calls on Reddit, 2-3 on TikTok (which actually works). Mechanical
  multi-platform search was started in CCI105 but not validated.
  4. LinkedIn returns job postings, not people's posts. Title searches like
  "field sales manager" return recruiting ads, not practitioners sharing
  experience. Need to search linkedin.com/posts/ or add personal language
  filters.
  5. No self-correction on bad ICP input. r/outsideSales 404s every time. Failed
   community feedback was added but search still defaults to r/sales. The
  pipeline needs to discover real communities from the reasoning model's
  industry keywords.

  Your Key Directives (Across Sessions)

  1. "Distributo has to find out by itself if the founder is wrong" — Stop
  hand-fixing ICPs
  2. "60% precision is not a success" — Need 90%+ strict, borderlines classified
   as "medium"
  3. "Keep the generous leads but classify them" — Confidence tiers, not binary
  4. "There is no end to high intent, it's distributo's fault" — The internet
  has enough people
  5. "Is it biased toward August?" — Remove all startup-specific examples from
  system prompts
  6. "Recency change is not a fix" — Find people within this week, don't expand
  the window
  7. "Why only one subreddit?" — Search multiple industry subreddits, not just
  r/sales

  Current State on Disk

  - 1,322 lines added across 7 files (uncommitted)
  - Session C's orchestrator.py version is live (most comprehensive)
  - Confidence field added but untested
  - Mechanical platform search added but untested
  - Best results: August 11 matches at $1.09, Scaylor 13 at $2.40

  ---
  Rewritten prompt based on all this context:

  Resume Distributo from CCI104-106. The pipeline works but has 3 blocking 
  problems:

  1. Search diversification is broken. The search agent spends 50% of tool calls
   on r/sales (0 matches) and 2-3 on TikTok (which works). CCI105 started a 
  _mechanical_platform_search in orchestrator.py but hit context limit before 
  validating it. Finish it: ensure the orchestrator runs parallel searches 
  across LinkedIn posts, TikTok, YouTube, industry subreddits (from 
  reasoning_model keywords), and discussion forums BEFORE the search agent runs.
   The search agent becomes supplemental, not sole.
  2. Precision/confidence untested. CCI104 session C added confidence: 
  high|medium to eval.py, icp_profile.py, and orchestrator.py match emission. 
  This has never been run end-to-end. Validate: run August and Scaylor, check 
  that confidence field appears in results, verify 90%+ of matches are "high", 
  and that "medium" matches are honestly borderline.
  3. Reddit query strategy. r/sales is 95% SaaS/inside. Search needs to discover
   INDUSTRY subreddits from the ICP's reasoning_model (hospitals → r/hospital, 
  HVAC → r/hvac, manufacturing → r/manufacturing). CCI105 added community 
  discovery guidance to the search prompt but the agent ignores it. Make this 
  mechanical: orchestrator extracts industry keywords from reasoning_model, 
  discovers which subreddits exist, and feeds them to the search agent as 
  verified communities.

  Files: matching_layer/orchestrator.py (mechanical search, industry discovery),
   matching_layer/agents/eval.py (confidence), matching_layer/agents/search.py 
  (generic prompt), matching_layer/icp_profile.py (Match dataclass), 
  test_august_fixed.py, test_scay_full.py.

  Don't touch comprehension. Don't change recency. Don't add August-specific 
  content anywhere. After fixes, run August then Scaylor. Audit every match with
   confidence level. Target: 10+ matches each, 90%+ high-confidence, under $3.

  The ICP should still have r/outsideSales (which 404s) — Distributo must handle
   that.

  Go?

✻ Churned for 2m 8s

❯ again borderline is good we need to include but note theyre borderline or 
  what they are instead of calling them a true match                        

● Right — include them, just be honest about what they are. That's exactly what
  the confidence: high|medium system does. High = "reach out now." Medium =
  "check their profile first." The founder sees both but knows which ones to
  trust immediately.

● The confidence tiers are working. I can see [MATCH:HIGH] and [MATCH:MEDIUM] in
   the output. Key observations:

  August cycle 1: 4 matches (2 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM) from 351 candidates. The
  mechanical Reddit discovery found r/MedicalDevices (real subreddit!) and
  that's where 3 of 4 matches came from. The confidence labeling is correct:
  - HIGH: Tricky_Appointment72 — self-identifies as "MDT rep here in CRM"
  (Medtronic rep)
  - HIGH: Any_Cardiologist_370 — first-person experience about "the job"
  - MEDIUM: CodMedium726 — "traveling the dirty south" field sales but thin
  signal
  - MEDIUM: Difficult_Amount_971 — med device sales compensation discussion

  Scaylor cycle 1: 3 matches (all HIGH) from 301 candidates. Found matches from
  both LinkedIn and Reddit (r/Netsuite). Good start.

  Both are now in cycle 2. Let me wait for completion.

  Confidence tiers work. The labeling is honest — MEDIUM matches are genuinely
  "probably but check their profile" (CodMedium726 describes field sales life
  but no title; Kevin Brown comments on enterprise pain but could be a
  consultant).

  But the volume is low. And you just told me exactly why.

  Your Point: Channel Intelligence

  When the system finds r/MedicalDevices and discovers that's where field sales
  reps actually are — it should:

  1. Read ALL posts from the past week in that subreddit, not just the ones from
   one search query
  2. Eval EVERY person and comment in those posts
  3. Learn and remember that r/MedicalDevices is a gold mine for August — store
  it so next run starts there
  4. The learning loop needs to work — no bugs, no constraints

  Right now the system finds r/MedicalDevices via the mechanical Reddit
  discovery, browses 25 posts, and passes them to eval. But it's only grabbing
  25 posts and not mining the comments. It should be exhaustively reading every
  post + every comment thread from the past week in that subreddit.

  Let me look at exactly where this breaks down and fix it.

● Let me check how communities are browsed and what the learning/storage looks
  like.

● Searched for 3 patterns, read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now I see the problems clearly:

  1. browse_subreddit has limit=25 default — it only grabs 25 posts. When a good
   community is found, it should grab ALL posts from the past week (could be
  100+)
  2. It gets posts AND comments (line 636-637) which is good, but limit=25 caps
  both
  3. _store_learnings doesn't store which communities produced matches — it
  stores queries_that_found_matches and audiences_that_responded (just platform
  names), but NOT the specific subreddits/communities
  4. _discover_and_search_reddit in the mechanical search also uses limit=25
  (line 1006)

  Let me fix all of this.

● Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now let me also check the community monitoring section to see the limits
  there.

● Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now I have the full picture. Here are the fixes:

  1. Increase limits — community monitoring uses limit=30, mechanical search
  uses limit=25. When a community is discovered, exhaust it (limit=100 for
  posts, comments are separate)
  2. Store successful communities in learnings — so next run starts by
  exhausting proven channels
  3. Track which communities produced matches — after eval, map matches back to
  their source community

● August is getting worse — 2 matches at $4.28. The problem is clear: 631
  NO_SIGNAL rejections means the vast majority of candidates have NO identity
  signal. Increasing the browse limit from 25 to 100 brought in more people but
  most of them are generic Reddit posters with no field sales identity in their
  posts.

  The core issue is that browsing a subreddit gives you posts + comments, but 
  most Reddit comments are generic and reveal nothing about who the person is.
  Eval correctly rejects them as NO_SIGNAL. More volume of generic posts doesn't
   help — it just costs more.

  Let me check what's actually happening with the cost spike and the real
  problem.

● Bash(cd /home/ishaa/Distributo && python3 -c "
      import json, os…)

● There it is. 612 out of ~800 candidates came from "mechanical" searches (the
  Reddit discovery + industry browsing). These are mostly generic subreddit
  browsers — people who posted in r/roofing, r/hvac, r/medicaldevices but their
  posts reveal nothing about being field SALES people. They might be
  technicians, homeowners, patients, etc.

  The problem: browsing an industry subreddit gives you everyone in that 
  industry, not specifically the ICP. A person in r/MedicalDevices could be a
  doctor, nurse, patient, device engineer, or sales rep. Eval correctly rejects
  95% as NO_SIGNAL because their posts don't reveal a sales role.

  The fix isn't more volume — it's smarter filtering before eval. When browsing
  r/MedicalDevices, instead of sending ALL 100 posts to eval, the system should
  pre-filter for posts that contain sales-adjacent language. Let me revert the
  limit back to something reasonable and instead add a pre-filter.

● Now the real insight here is what you said: when a community IS good (produces
   matches), the system should remember it and go deeper. The issue isn't
  "browse more posts upfront." It's: after eval finds matches from 
  r/MedicalDevices, circle back and mine every thread those matches came from, 
  and search that specific subreddit with ICP-relevant queries.

  Let me check if there's post-eval channel exploitation logic.

● Searched for 1 pattern (ctrl+o to expand)

● The feedback at line 1249 tells the search agent to mine_thread match URLs,
  but the search agent might not do it. Let me add a mechanical thread mining 
  step after cycle 1 eval — for every match, mine its thread to find peers.

● Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● I see the cycle loop. After eval finds matches, I need to add a step that
  mines every match's thread to find peers. Let me add this after the "Mark
  matches as seen for dedup" block.

● Wait — candidates isn't in scope at that point in the cycle loop. The
  candidates list is consumed earlier. I need to think about this differently.
  The thread mining results should go into the next eval batch, not into
  candidates. Let me fix the approach — store them and inject into the next
  cycle.

● Now inject the hot channels into the feedback so the search agent knows to
  focus there.

● Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now let me add hot channel intelligence to the feedback builder. Let me inject
   it right after feedback is built.
