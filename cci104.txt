● Here's my review of both sessions:

  ---
  Session B (2fdbc766) — "The Evaluator"

  What it's doing: Resumed from CCI97/98, running full Distributo pipeline
  evaluations for August. This is the session that:

  1. Ran August traced test (batch size 5) → 10 matches, audited each one →
  found 20% precision (2 true positives, 4 borderline, 4 false positives — HVAC
  techs, carpenter)
  2. Proved batch degradation is real (3/4 HVAC techs rejected individually, all
   matched in batch)
  3. Confirmed HVAC techs ARE false positives (August is "field SALES" not
  "field SERVICE")
  4. Reviewed session C's comprehension.py fix — confirmed it works and handles
  all users (with or without landing page)
  5. Then tried to commit all 7 files... but you told it to run the full
  pipeline first
  6. Ran full pipeline → $6.47, 10 matches, ~30% precision — still bad. New
  false positives: enterprise account directors, generic sales reps, r/HVAC
  posters with zero field signal
  7. Diagnosed 3 specific bugs in eval.py lines 30-34-43: "being the person IS
  enough", "you CAN match on identity/role alignment", "in the right INDUSTRY...
   still a match" — these let eval speculate instead of requiring evidence
  8. Was about to fix eval.py and you told it to actually investigate instead of
   blindly guessing — it started tracing FPs backwards through the pipeline

  Current state: Investigating where in the pipeline FPs are created. Found that
   the trace doesn't log what text eval actually sees. Was digging into
  enrichment/search to find the root cause. Hasn't committed anything yet.

  ---
  Session C (9b455dd6) — "The Fixer"

  What it did: Implemented the comprehension extraction prompt fix. This
  session:

  1. Fixed comprehension.py:210 — extraction prompt now requires FUNCTION (what
  they DO) not just LOCATION
  2. Initially also hand-fixed test ICPs (SERVICE_TECHNICIAN false positive,
  etc.) — then you called it out: "you're fixing the tests, the agent should fix
   itself"
  3. Correctly reverted the test ICP hand-fixes, kept only the comprehension.py
  extraction prompt change
  4. Tested the extraction prompt against 3 products:
    - August: auto-generated "field service managers" as false positive
    - Scay: auto-generated "BI analysts, data engineers with custom pipelines"
    - YouTubeSponsorDB: auto-generated "YouTube creators, agencies with own DBs"
  5. All 15/15 checks passed across 3 products
  6. Then got derailed into a skills/rules audit question

  Current state: The comprehension.py fix is done and validated. Session was
  pivoting to auditing your skills/rules/tools setup. You asked it to run critic
   agent on the backend but it pushed back saying batch-of-20 isn't accurate and
   things it didn't understand were being changed.

  ---
  Key Findings

  What's working: The comprehension.py extraction prompt fix (session C) is
  solid — validated across 3 products, auto-generates the right
  function-vs-location distinctions.

  What's still broken: Session B proved that even with good comprehension,
  eval.py is too permissive — it matches on speculation ("posts in r/HVAC" →
  "HVAC industry" → match). The eval prompt has 3 lines that act as a blank
  check. Session B was mid-investigation, tracing FPs back through the pipeline
  to find the actual root cause.

  Nothing is committed. Both sessions have uncommitted changes on disk. Session
  B has 7 modified files from multiple sessions. The only change that matters
  for certain is comprehension.py.

  The $6.47/run at 30% precision problem is unsolved. The comprehension fix
  improves ICP generation but doesn't fix eval's permissiveness or the search
  cost.

✻ Churned for 1m 32s

❯ i need to have good/perfect tests for each component of this pipeline. i  
  think you already made august comprehesnion. but now make a fixed test    
  for search functionality and for eval. again, youre gonna need to think   
  this out because if you make the wrong/bad tests that look good on the    
  surface, nothing is gonna be solved. /meta-prompt and go                  

● Here's what I understand you want:

  Create tests that would have caught the bugs sessions B and C found. Not "does
   the function return a dict" tests — tests that encode the actual failure 
  modes: eval matching HVAC techs on speculation, eval treating subreddit 
  membership as evidence, search returning candidates with empty text fields. 
  Tests that if they pass, mean the pipeline actually works. If they fail, point
   at the exact component that's broken.

  Three test files: test_comprehension.py (exists), test_search.py (new), 
  test_eval.py (new). Each tests the component in isolation with real-world 
  failure cases derived from the bugs we already found.

  Let me investigate the current codebase first, then build them.

● scout(Investigate Distributo pipeline)
  ⎿  Done (20 tool uses · 95.6k tokens · 4m 22s)
  ⎿  Running PostToolUse hooks… (1/2 done)

● Good research. Now let me read the existing test files to match their patterns
   exactly.

● Read 3 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now let me read the current eval.py prompt and search.py to see the actual
  code I'm testing against.

● Read 2 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now I have everything I need. Let me think about this carefully and write the
  tests.

  The key insight: tests should encode the exact failure modes we discovered, 
  not theoretical ones. The existing trace_eval.py and trace_eval_batch.py are
  diagnostic traces, not proper tests with pass/fail assertions. And they use
  the hand-fixed ICP (with SERVICE_TECHNICIAN already added) — that's cheating.
  The real test is: does the pipeline work with the original imperfect ICP that
  a real founder interaction would produce?

  Let me also think about search: the failure wasn't just "bad queries" — it was
   that candidates came back with empty/thin text, and communities like r/HVAC
  are full of techs not sales reps. A good search test validates the output
  quality, not just that it returns results.

● Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now I have everything. Let me write both test files. Here's the thinking:

  Eval test design:
  - Uses known true positives and false positives from the sessions (real data
  that actually broke the pipeline)
  - Tests each candidate INDIVIDUALLY first (no batch degradation hiding bugs)
  - Then tests in a BATCH and compares results
  - Asserts on rejection CATEGORY, not just match/reject
  - Includes the edge cases that broke things: HVAC techs, subreddit-only
  signal, consultant writing about the domain
  - Exits with nonzero status on failure — this is a real test, not a trace

  Search test design:
  - Tests tool functions directly (cheap, no Claude API)
  - Validates output structure and data quality
  - Tests that candidates have non-empty text (the bug where eval got empty
  strings)
  - One targeted search agent run to validate query quality and platform
  diversity

  test_search_component.py — Search Tool & Agent Tests

  7 tests across two levels:

  Tool-level (cheap, no Claude API):
  1. search_reddit — returns candidates with real usernames and text
  2. browse_subreddit — observation returns posts with content
  3. search_serper_discussions — cross-web forum results
  4. candidate_dict_structure — SearchResult has all fields eval needs
  5. mine_thread — extracts commenters from a Reddit thread
  6. situation_vs_emotion — situation queries ("logging visits driving between
  accounts") vs emotion queries ("frustrated with CRM")

  Agent-level (expensive, opt-in with --full):
  7. Full search agent cycle — validates candidate count, text fill rate,
  platform diversity, broken candidates

  Quality thresholds enforced:
  - Text fill rate >= 50% (eval can't judge empty strings)
  - Author fill rate >= 50% (can't DM without a username)
  - Average text length >= 30 chars (too short = no signal)

  Run search tests with python3 test_search_component.py (tool tests only,
  cheap) or python3 test_search_component.py --full (includes agent cycle, ~$2).

✻ Brewed for 11m 42s

❯  The user is asking me to evaluate whether these test designs are         
  correct. Let me think about this critically.                              
                                                                            
  The tests are August-specific. Every single test candidate is designed    
  around the August ICP (field sales manager, HVAC service tech, CRM        
  consultant, etc.). This is the SAME problem the user just called out —    
  designing everything around one startup.                                  
                                                                            
  Let me think about what's wrong:                                          
                                                                            
  1. test_eval_component.py — All 13 candidates are August-specific.        
  FP_hvac_service_tech, FP_carpenter, FP_crm_consultant — these are         
  August false positives. For a different startup (say, a project           
  management tool), the false positives would be completely different.      
                                                                            
  The test is testing "does eval work for August" not "does eval work       
  generically." The real issue is that the tests should verify the          
  system's core logic — whether eval correctly identifies identity          
  evidence, rejects missing evidence, and catches known disqualifying       
  patterns like vendor roles, coaches, and job postings — rather than       
  validating August-specific judgment calls.                                
                                                                            
  2. test_search_component.py — The tool-level tests seem more generic      
  (search returns results, text fill rate, etc.), but the "situation vs     
  emotion" test likely uses August-specific queries, and the agent-level    
  test probably relies on the August ICP as well.                           
                                                                            
  The candidates in the eval test actually do test generic behaviors        
  through August examples — like distinguishing function from location,     
  recognizing that community membership isn't identity evidence, and        
  enforcing burden of proof — which is appropriate for a component test     
  since the eval prompt itself is generic. The real question is whether     
  these tests are actually validating the right behaviors or if             
  they're just confirming August-specific outcomes. the eval prompt to      
  handle imperfect founder input — whether it can infer the real ICP        
  from incomplete reasoning. But the user's core concern is that these      
  tests are August-specific and don't prove the system generalizes          
  across different startups, which is what they've been emphasizing all     
  along. I need to verify the expected outcomes match our updated eval      
  logic: the fantasy football post should still be a match since there's    
  concrete identity evidence of a field sales manager, but I'm              
  uncertain about the HVAC tech case. The core issue is that these tests    
  are too narrowly tailored to the August use case when the product         
  should work across different startup profiles, so I need to either        
  expand the test coverage to multiple ICPs or at least ensure the eval     
  criteria measure general behaviors rather than August-specific            
  patterns.                                                                 
                                                                            
  ● They're August tests pretending to be system tests. Every candidate is  
  designed around one ICP — HVAC service tech, CRM consultant,              
  carpenter. For a project management tool founder, none of these false     
  positive types exist. For a nursing platform, the false positives         
  are completely different.                                                 
                                                                            
  What the tests actually prove: "eval works for August." What they         
  should prove: "eval works for ANY founder."                               
                                                                            
  Specific problems:                                                        
                                                                            
  1. All 13 candidates are August-specific. FP_hvac_service_tech tests      
  one founder's false positive. A real system test would use 2-3            
  different ICPs and verify eval handles each one's unique false            
  positives — which the COMPREHENSION agent generated, not a human          
  hand-wrote.                                                               
  2. The test hardcodes the "right answers." If the ICP says "reps are ON   
  THE ROAD, not behind a desk" (the imperfect version), should an           
  HVAC tech be rejected? The test says yes, but the ICP never mentions      
  service techs. The test is encoding YOUR judgment of what eval should     
  do, not testing whether eval can reason from the ICP it's given.          
  3. The search tests are better — tool-level tests (text fill rate,        
  author fill rate, structure) are genuinely generic. Those test            
  infrastructure, not judgment. The situation-vs-emotion test is probably   
  August-specific though.                                                   
  4. Missing: the test that actually matters. Give comprehension a raw      
  product description → it generates ICP → search finds candidates →        
  eval judges them → measure precision. End-to-end, no hand-written ICP,    
  no hand-picked candidates. That's the test that proves the SYSTEM         
  works, not that one ICP's test cases pass.                                
                                                                            
  The eval component test should be: give it an ICP (any ICP) and           
  candidates with clear/no identity evidence, verify it requires evidence   
  to                                                                        
  match. The search test should verify coverage and cost regardless of      
  ICP. The real test is end-to-end with a live comprehension run.           
                                                                            
  Want me to rewrite these tests to be generic, or do you want to run the   
  end-to-end pipeline first to see if the root fixes actually moved         
  precision?                                                                

● Your critique is partially right and partially wrong. Let me separate them.

  Where you're right:
  - Adding 2-3 ICPs (Scay, YouTubeSponsorDB) would prove generalization. One ICP
   proves nothing about the system.
  - The end-to-end test (comprehension generates ICP → search → eval → measure
  precision) is the test that actually proves the product works. Component tests
   can all pass and the system can still be broken.

  Where you're wrong:
  - "The test hardcodes YOUR judgment of what eval should do" — no. The test
  uses the CURRENT ICP which explicitly says SERVICE_TECHNICIAN in
  false_positives and "FUNCTION not location" in the reasoning model. An HVAC
  tech being rejected isn't my judgment — it's what the ICP instructs. If eval
  can't follow its own ICP, that's a bug.
  - "For a project management tool, none of these false positive types exist" —
  6 of the 13 tests are generic eval behaviors that apply to ANY ICP: vendor
  detection, recruiter detection, no-signal rejection, consultant pattern,
  speculation rejection, universal mode. These test the eval PROMPT, not the
  ICP. Only the HVAC/carpenter tests are August-specific.
  - Component tests are supposed to test components in isolation with known
  inputs/outputs. That's not "pretending to be system tests" — it's what
  component tests are. You asked for component tests.

  What actually matters:
  The end-to-end test is the one that proves the product works. But you need
  component tests too — when end-to-end fails, component tests tell you WHICH
  component broke. Without them you're back to "is it comprehension? search?
  eval?" guessing.

  Here's what I'd do: add Scay and YouTubeSponsorDB ICPs to the eval component
  test (3 ICPs instead of 1), keep the search tool-level tests as-is (they're
  already generic), and then run the real end-to-end pipeline to see if
  precision actually moved. The end-to-end result is what matters — the
  component tests are for debugging when it doesn't.

  Want me to add the multi-ICP eval tests, or run the pipeline end-to-end first
  to see where precision actually stands?

✻ Crunched for 37s

❯ i am. im literally asking you to read and fix the tests.  

● Let me read the modified file.

● Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● Good, the restructuring is solid. Two ICPs, behavior-based organization,
  imperfect ICP on purpose. Let me check the search file too.

● Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● Both files are clean. Your restructuring is better than what I wrote. Three
  things to fix:

  1. The HVAC tech test (reject_service_tech_not_sales) is the hardest and most 
  important test — and it might fail.

  The imperfect ICP doesn't have SERVICE_TECHNICIAN in false_positives and the
  reasoning model says "reps are on the road, not behind a desk." The HVAC tech
  text says "I drive to customer locations every day" and "paperwork is killing
  me" — that matches the reasoning model's keywords almost perfectly. Eval's
  system prompt says "you need ONE concrete signal they ARE the ICP" and the
  tech has: drives to locations, hates paperwork, field work. The MISSING signal
   is "sales" — they fix furnaces, not sell. Whether Sonnet catches that gap
  with this imperfect ICP is genuinely uncertain.

  This is actually a valuable test either way. If it passes, eval's
  burden-of-proof enforcement works without explicit guidance. If it fails, it
  proves you need the comprehension fix (SERVICE_TECHNICIAN in false_positives)
  and the system can't rely on eval alone. But you should know it might fail
  before you run it.

  2. The reject_line_cook_not_owner test has a subtle issue. The line cook says
  "Management doesn't care. I'm just the line cook." That explicitly says "I'm
  NOT management" — eval should reject easily. A harder test would be a line
  cook who doesn't self-identify, just complains about inventory. But as written
   it's fine because the self-identification makes it a clean test of whether
  eval reads the text.

  3. The search test test_search_serper_discussions switched from a field sales 
  query to a restaurant query ("restaurant owner inventory management pain").
  This is an improvement — it tests a second domain. But the word "pain" in the
  query is emotion-based, which contradicts the situation-vs-emotion principle
  the test suite is testing. Should be something like "restaurant owner counting
   inventory calling suppliers weekly".

● That's the only code fix needed. Both files parse and are structurally
  correct. The test designs are sound — behavior-based, multi-ICP, with the
  right assertions.

  The one open question is whether reject_service_tech_not_sales passes with the
   imperfect ICP. That's the test that tells you whether eval can enforce burden
   of proof without hand-holding from comprehension. Want to run the eval tests
  and find out?

● Now the line cook doesn't self-identify — they do inventory-adjacent work
  (calling suppliers, dealing with shortages) which overlaps with the owner's
  activities, but there's no evidence they own or manage the restaurant. Eval
  has to distinguish role from activity, not just read "I'm just the line cook."

  Reasoning: Describes data across CRM, QuickBooks, Google Calendar,        
  Slack — exact fragmentation pain. Spent "30-40 minute rabbit holes"

  3 clear yes, 1 borderline. That's decent quality but terrible volume —    
  4 matches from 400+ candidates evaluated.                                 
                                                                            
  Scaylor-specific issues:                                                  
  1. No false_positives generated — the comprehension agent produced an     
  empty false_positives list. This means eval had no guidance on who to     
  reject and                                                                
  defaulted to the generic burden-of-proof logic.                           
  2. 79 COACH_CONSULTANT in cycle 3 alone — enterprise data/integration     
  space is dominated by consultants and vendors on LinkedIn. Search keeps   
  finding                                                                   
  them.                                                                     
  3. Many "anonymous" candidates in cycle 3 — enrichment failed to get      
  real usernames from some sources. Can't DM anonymous people.              
  4. r/operations 404 — another fake subreddit the search agent invented.   
  5. reasoning_model was empty in the trace — the comprehension agent       
  produced an ICP but the reasoning model didn't get logged or was          
  truncated.                                                                
                                                                            
  Systemic Issues Across Both Runs                                          
                                                                            
  1. Eval is too strict. The CCI102 burden-of-proof fix went too far.       
  "MATCH only with concrete identity evidence" rejects anyone whose post    
  describes                                                                 
  the SITUATION without stating their job title. A field sales rep          
  complaining about CRM updates from their car IS the ICP even if they      
  don't say "I am a                                                         
  VP of Sales." The eval prompt needs to accept situational evidence,       
  not just role-title evidence.                                             
  2. Search invents subreddits. r/outsidesales, r/salesmanagement,          
  r/medicaldevice, r/operations — all don't exist. The search agent         
  hallucinates                                                              
  community names. This wastes API calls and misses real communities.       
  3. LinkedIn is dominated by consultants/vendors. Both runs had massive    
  COACH_CONSULTANT and VENDOR rejection counts. Search needs to be smarter  
  about                                                                     
  filtering LinkedIn results — look for practitioners posting about their   
  daily experience, not thought leaders promoting content.                  
  4. Comprehension didn't generate false_positives for Scaylor. The         
  extraction prompt should always generate at least 4 types. It failed.     
  5. NO_SIGNAL is the dominant rejection in early cycles (45/105 for        
  August cycle 1, 69/148 for Scaylor cycle 1). These are candidates with    
  too little                                                                
  text for eval to judge. Either search is returning low-signal             
  candidates, or eval is being too conservative with what counts as         
  "signal."                                                                 
                                                                            
  What needs fixing (priority order):                                       
                                                                            
  1. Eval prompt recalibration — Accept situation-as-evidence, not just     
  role-title-as-evidence. "Drives to customer sites, updates CRM from car"  
  is                                                                        
  evidence even without "VP of Sales" in the text.                          
  2. Comprehension false_positives generation — Force it to always          
  produce at least 4 types. Empty list = no eval guidance.                  
  3. Subreddit validation — Before searching a subreddit, check if it       
  exists (HEAD request or similar). Don't waste cycles on 404s.             
  4. Search LinkedIn filtering — Deprioritize or filter results that look   
  like thought leadership / promotional content.                            
                                                                            
  Want me to fix these now, starting with the eval prompt recalibration?

  passed 100 percent, how come the agent failed? 4 matches is not enough at 
  all. and do we learn from success and failure or no? /meta-prompt and     
  execute the prompt.

  The user is making several critical points:                               
                                                                            
  1. The eval is doing keyword matching (looking for role titles) instead   
  of semantic understanding. "It's not about keyword matching" - the whole  
  point                                                                     
  of Distributo is SEMANTIC matching. The eval should understand WHO        
  someone is from what they write, not look for job title keywords.         
  2. The tests passed 100% but the live agent failed miserably (1 match     
  for August, 4 for Scaylor). This means the tests are bad - they don't     
  reflect                                                                   
  reality. The tests are testing the wrong things.                          
  3. "Do we learn from success and failure?" - Does the system have a       
  feedback loop? Does it learn from what worked and what didn't across      
  runs? Looking                                                             
  at the code, there's a "compound_learning" mechanism mentioned in the     
  orchestrator, but it seems rudimentary.                                   
                                                                            
  4. The core issues are that the evaluation needs to shift from            
  surface-level pattern matching to genuine semantic understanding, the     
  test suite needs                                                          
  to be rebuilt to actually validate real-world performance, and the        
  learning mechanism needs to be strengthened so the system improves with   
  each                                                                      
  iteration. I should clarify these priorities with the user before         
  diving into fixes.                                                        
                                                                            
  ● Here's what I understand you want:                                      
                                                                            
  Three things are broken and they're connected:                            
                                                                            
  1. Eval is keyword matching, not semantic matching. The whole point of    
  Distributo is understanding WHO someone is from what they write. The eval 
  prompt                                                                    
  says "need concrete identity evidence — a role title, a described         
  daily activity." That's looking for keywords. A person describing their   
  daily                                                                     
  reality of driving between hospital accounts and updating CRM at 9pm IS   
  the ICP — the eval should UNDERSTAND that from the semantics, not reject  
  because "VP of Sales" doesn't appear in the text. The CCI102 fix broke    
  the core promise of the product.                                          
  2. Tests passed 100% but the live agent got 1 match (August) and 4        
  matches (Scaylor). The tests are lying. They test hand-picked candidates  
  with clear                                                                
  signals against hand-picked ICPs. Real-world candidates are messy,        
  ambiguous, short posts. The tests don't predict real performance —        
  they're vanity                                                            
  metrics.                                                                  
  3. No learning loop. The system sees 172 rejections for August and        
  learns nothing. It doesn't know that TikTok med device reps worked last   
  time. It                                                                  
  doesn't know that LinkedIn coaches are always false positives. Every      
  run starts from zero. The compound_learning mechanism in the orchestrator 
  exists                                                                    
  but clearly isn't working — the system should get BETTER over time, not   
  stay the same.                                                            
                                                                            
  Fix all three: recalibrate eval to be semantic (not keyword), make        
  tests reflect real performance, wire up learning from success/failure.    
  Then rerun

  Run this?                                                                 
                                                                            
  ❯ there is a learning loop and feedback loop but youre not utilizing      
  either of them. theyre probably not correct, so fix both of them after    
  diving

  what                                                                      
  worked and what didn't?                                                   
  3. Any memory/learning storage — look for files, databases, JSON          
  storage of past run results. Check for LayeredMemory, any persistence     
  layer.                                                                    
  4. The _refine_reasoning_model method — what does it do with              
  rejection data?                                                           
  5. Any event types related to learning: compound_learning_applied,        
  memory_hit, etc.                                                          
  6. Look in the mas/ directory for any memory or learning                  
  infrastructure.                                                           
                                                                            
  Read the actual code for each. I need to know exactly what exists,        
  what's wired up, and what's broken or not being used.

● The tests passed 100% but the agent got 1 match. That means the tests are
  testing fantasy, not reality. The problem: every test candidate has obvious
  signals like "Managing 20 outside sales reps" or "I own two Italian
  restaurants." Real candidates are messy — they describe their situation
  without stating their job title, and the overcorrected eval rejects them all
  as NO_SIGNAL.

  The fix: add candidates that reflect real-world ambiguity — situational
  evidence without explicit role titles. These would have FAILED with the
  overcorrected eval and caught the bug before the live run.

● Now I see the eval prompt. Line 29-32 lists what counts as a "concrete signal"
   — it already includes "described activity" and "situation matches" as valid
  evidence. But line 44 and line 51 are the overcorrection:

  - Line 44: "Short comment with NO identity signal → REJECT as NO_SIGNAL. Do
  NOT speculate."
  - Line 51: "No concrete evidence... You need evidence of their ROLE or
  FUNCTION, not just their environment."

  The problem: someone describing "updating CRM from my car after visiting 6
  accounts today" IS describing their activity, which line 31 says is valid. But
   eval is reading line 44/51 more aggressively and rejecting because there's no
   explicit "I'm a sales manager." The prompt contradicts itself — line 31 says
  activity counts, line 44/51 say "don't speculate." Eval resolves the
  contradiction by being conservative.

  The eval prompt fix and the test fix are the same problem. The tests need
  candidates that test whether eval accepts situational evidence. Let me fix
  both.

● The missing test category is situation-as-evidence — people describing their
  daily reality without stating their job title. These are the candidates the
  overcorrected eval rejected as NO_SIGNAL in the live run. The tests need them
  so that if eval overcorrects again, the tests FAIL.

● Now fix the eval prompt. The overcorrection is in lines 29-35 and 44 and 51 —
  they demand "role title" evidence and say "do NOT speculate" which makes eval
  reject situational evidence. The prompt needs to explicitly say that
  describing the ICP's daily activities IS evidence.

● Here's what changed:

  Added 5 situational-evidence tests — the missing category that would have
  caught the overcorrection:
  Test: match_situation_field_sales_no_title
  ICP: field_sales
  What it tests: Drove 180 miles, 6 accounts, updating Salesforce from parking
    lot — no title stated
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Test: match_situation_field_sales_short_post
  ICP: field_sales
  What it tests: Short post: drove to customer site, territory, pipeline notes
  in
     parking lot
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Test: match_situation_field_sales_complaint
  ICP: field_sales
  What it tests: Walks into 8 hospitals/week, pitches device, manager has no
    visibility — never says "field sales rep"
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Test: match_situation_restaurant_no_title
  ICP: restaurant
  What it tests: Counting cans at the bar after close, building order sheets,
    food cost at 31% — never says "I own"
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Test: match_situation_restaurant_short
  ICP: restaurant
  What it tests: 86'd avocado, called supplier about a short delivery — someone
    making purchasing decisions
  Total now: 20 tests (was 15). 9 MATCH, 11 REJECT. 13 field_sales, 7
  restaurant.

  The balance shifted from "mostly rejection tests with obvious match
  candidates" to "equal match/reject with the hardest match tests being the
  situational ones." These 5 tests would have FAILED with the overcorrected eval
   (rejected as NO_SIGNAL) and caught the bug before the live run.

  The eval prompt was already fixed by the other session — it now says
  "situation IS evidence" and "a single vivid detail about their daily reality
  can be stronger evidence than a job title." The tests and the prompt are now
  aligned.

❯ are you sure you got the tests right? be adversarial and find edge cases. 
  infintie semantic understnading doesnt mean 20 users it means 10000       
  users and ways they talk and everyhtign. true matching. i feel like the   
  tests are wrong. you can tell me im wrong if im wrong.                    

● You're right that 20 hand-picked candidates is nothing like 10,000 real
  people. But you're wrong that the tests themselves are wrong — you're
  conflating two different things.

  Component tests and semantic understanding are different problems.

  A component test asks: "given this input, does eval produce the right output?"
   20 well-chosen candidates that cover the behavioral categories
  (situation-as-evidence, no-signal, vendor, consultant,
  same-env-different-function) is the right number for a component test. You
  don't need 10,000 candidates to test whether eval rejects a vendor. You need 1
   vendor candidate and an assertion.

  What you actually want — testing semantic understanding at scale — is a 
  different kind of test entirely. That's not a component test. That's an
  evaluation benchmark. You'd need:
  1. A corpus of real Reddit/LinkedIn posts (not synthetic ones I wrote)
  2. Human labels (or your own labels) on each one: match/reject
  3. Run eval on the corpus, measure precision/recall

  The synthetic candidates I wrote have a fundamental problem you're sensing but
   naming wrong: I wrote them to be recognizable. "Drove 180 miles to 6
  accounts, updating Salesforce from the parking lot" — I wrote that knowing
  what the ICP looks like. Real people don't talk like test fixtures. They say:

  - "man today sucked. 6 stops and the last one cancelled while I was in the
  parking lot"
  - "anyone else's manager obsess over Salesforce notes? like bro I just drove 4
   hours"
  - "the worst part of this job is the windshield time tbh"

  Those are harder. Eval needs to recognize "windshield time" as a field sales
  signal without me writing a test candidate that literally describes the ICP.

  So the real question is: do you want me to make the component tests harder 
  with messier candidates, or do you want to build an actual evaluation 
  benchmark from real data?

  The component tests catch regressions (eval prompt broke, overcorrected,
  stopped rejecting vendors). The benchmark measures whether the system actually
   understands people. Both are needed, but they're different tools.

❯ i want real eval benchmark for distributo. not fake stuff, real data. you 
  can start by looking at cci54 and using that data. communitywatch         
  matches(they ar a competotor for distributo)

  ⎿ PreToolUse:Read says: # Agent Context Isolation

    Prevent agent output from polluting the main context window.

    ## Rules

    ### 1. Use Background Agents with File-Based Coordination
    ```
    # RIGHT - background agent writes to file, main reads file
    Task(subagent_type="...", run_in_background=true, prompt="... Output to: 
    /path/to/file.md")

    # WRONG - foreground agent dumps full transcript into main context
    Task(subagent_type="...", run_in_background=false)
    ```

    Background agents with `run_in_background=true` isolate their context. Have 
    them write results to files in `.claude/cache/agents/<agent-type>/`.

    ### 2. Never Use TaskOutput to Retrieve Results
    ```
    # WRONG - dumps entire transcript (70k+ tokens) into context
    TaskOutput(task_id="<id>")
    TaskOutput(task_id="<id>", block=true)

    # RIGHT - check expected output files
    Bash("ls -la .claude/cache/agents/<agent-type>/")
    Bash("bun test")  # verify with tests
    ```

    TaskOutput returns the full agent transcript. Always use file-based 
    coordination instead.

    ### 3. Monitor Agent Progress via System Reminders
    ```
    # System reminders come automatically:
    # "Agent a42a16e progress: 6 new tools used, 88914 new tokens"

    # To detect completion:
    # - Watch for progress reminders to stop arriving
    # - Poll for expected output files: find .claude/cache/agents -name "*.md" 
    -mmin -5
    # - Check task output file size growth: wc -c 
    /tmp/claude/.../tasks/<id>.output
    ```

    **Stuck agent detection:**
    1. Progress reminders stop arriving
    2. Task output file size stops growing
    3. Expected output file not created after reasonable time

    ### 4. Verify with Tests, Not Output
    After agent work:
    1. Run the test suite directly: `bun test`
    2. Report pass/fail counts
    3. Only investigate failures if tests fail

    ### 5. File-Based Agent Pipeline Pattern
    ```
    Research agent → .claude/cache/agents/oracle/output.md
                              ↓
    Plan agent → .claude/cache/agents/plan-agent/output.md (reads research)
                              ↓
    Validate agent → .claude/cache/agents/validate-agent/output.md (reads plan)
                              ↓
    Implement agent → src/module.ts (reads validated plan)
    ```

    Each agent reads the previous agent's file output, not TaskOutput.

    ## Why This Matters

    Agent context isolation preserves the main conversation's context budget. 
    Reading agent outputs via TaskOutput floods context, causing:
    - Mid-conversation compaction
    - Lost context about user's original request
    - Repeated explanations needed

❯ so looks like our search functionality/component is ass. : The August run 
  found 0 matches from 180 candidates. The Scaylor run found 8 from ~270.   
  The problem is NOT eval — eval's rejections are mostly correct.           
  The problem is search is looking in the wrong places and using the        
  wrong queries.                                                            
                                                                            
  Fix the search agent (matching_layer/agents/search.py) and the August     
  ICP (test_august_fixed.py) to actually find field sales people.           
  Specifics:                                                                
                                                                            
  1. August ICP communities are wrong. r/outsideSales returns 404 every     
  time. Replace with real communities: r/sales (already there),             
  r/medicaldevice (if                                                       
  it exists — verify), and critically add LinkedIn with specific            
  title-based queries and TikTok/YouTube where field reps actually post     
  (med device reps                                                          
  film from their cars, HVAC techs post walkarounds). The ICP's             
  communities list should only contain communities that actually exist.     
  2. Search queries are too topical, not identity-based. Queries like       
  "field sales manager reps not updating salesforce" find consultants and   
  thought                                                                   
  leaders writing ABOUT the topic. Fix the search agent's query             
  generation to prioritize first-person identity queries: "I drive to"      
  site:reddit.com, "my                                                      
  territory" "updating CRM", "after 8 hours of driving" sales,              
  site:tiktok.com field sales day in the life. The search prompt in         
  search.py should                                                          
  instruct the agent to search for people BEING the ICP, not people         
  DISCUSSING the ICP's topic.                                               
  3. Coverage mode "universal" means ANY field sales person is a match —    
  they don't need to be complaining about CRM. A field sales manager        
  posting about                                                             
  fantasy football is still a field sales manager. Search should also       
  look for people who ARE the ICP in non-problem contexts: LinkedIn         
  profiles with                                                             
  the right title, Reddit users who've identified themselves as field       
  sales in ANY post.                                                        
  4. The internet is infinite. 180 candidates with 0 matches means search   
  failed, not that field sales people don't exist. Don't accept 0 matches.  
  If a                                                                      
  cycle produces 0, the next cycle should dramatically change approach —    
  different platforms, different query patterns, not just different         
  keywords on                                                               
  the same platforms.                                                       
  5. Same principle for Scaylor — 8 matches is decent but anyone in         
  enterprise with 5+ systems experiences data fragmentation. There are      
  thousands of                                                              
  these people posting. If high-intent candidates dry up, find              
  ICP-identity candidates (VP of IT at manufacturing company posting about  
  ANYTHING).                                                                
                                                                            
  After fixing, re-run both pipelines and audit the results. Target: 10+    
  matches for each at under $3.                                             
                                                                            
  - "find ICP" when high-intent dries up = universal coverage should        
  search for IDENTITY not just PAIN                                         
  - The search prompt itself needs to change how it thinks about query      
  generation

       84 -CRITICAL — WHERE TO SEARCH:                                   
       85 -The ICP profile includes a communities list. USE IT. Those    
          -communities were chosen because the buyer's PEERS hang out    
          -there. Don't override with your own guesses.                  
       86 -- If the ICP lists specific communities, search THOSE FIRST.  
       87 -- LinkedIn is the BEST source for managers, directors, VPs,   
          -and anyone with a professional title. Use it heavily.         
       88 -- Use search_discussions to find conversations across the     
          -ENTIRE web — don't limit yourself to Reddit.                  
       89 -- If the ICP doesn't list communities, reason about where     
          -someone with the buyer's specific ROLE would talk to PEERS    
          -who do the same job.

          +produced 0 matches or very few:                               
       85 +- Do NOT retry the same approach with different keywords      
       86 +- SWITCH platforms entirely — if Reddit produced 0, go to     
          +LinkedIn or YouTube
