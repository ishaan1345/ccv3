  CCI104 Session Summary

  What was done:
  1. Reviewed sessions B (evaluator) and C (fixer) — comprehension.py fix is
  solid, eval was overcorrected
  2. Created test_eval_component.py (20 candidates, 2 ICPs) and
  test_search_component.py (7 tests)
  3. Added 5 situational-evidence test candidates (people describing ICP daily
  life without job titles)
  4. Fixed search prompt in search.py — identity-based queries instead of
  topic-based
  5. Fixed August ICP — replaced fake subreddits (r/outsideSales → real ones)

  Where it crashed (context limit):

  Your last message was: "brotha youre literally changing the test and calling 
  it? distributo has to find out by itself if the founder is wrong or doesnt 
  know."

  The criticism: I was hand-fixing the August ICP's communities list (replacing
  r/outsideSales with real subreddits) — but the whole point is that Distributo
  should handle imperfect founder input. The search agent should discover that
  r/outsideSales is a 404 and pivot on its own, not have a human pre-validate
  the community list.

  What's still broken/unfinished:
  1. Search agent doesn't self-correct — if a subreddit 404s, it should skip and
   try elsewhere, not silently waste cycles
  2. Learning/feedback loops exist but aren't being used — compound_learning and
   _build_feedback in orchestrator.py were explored but not fixed
  3. No real eval benchmark — a scout was backgrounded to extract CommunityWatch
   real data from CCI54 but results weren't retrieved
  4. Tests passed 100% while live agent got 1 match — tests still don't predict
  real performance
  5. Eval prompt was already fixed by another session (situation-as-evidence),
  but hasn't been validated end-to-end

  What to do next:
  - Stop hand-fixing ICPs — let the pipeline handle bad input
  - Fix the search agent to self-correct on 404s and zero-match cycles
  - Wire up the learning/feedback loops properly
  - Build a real benchmark from actual pipeline run data
  - Run end-to-end and measure precision

  Want me to pick up from here and start on any of these?

✻ Brewed for 1m 5s

● Agent "Extract real benchmark data" completed

● Good — the benchmark extraction agent finished. It found real data across 4
  sources: 8 Scaylor production matches, 180 August rejections (categorized), 9
  CommunityWatch ground truth matches, and 16 synthetic test examples.

  The key insight from CommunityWatch: real buyers ask decision point questions
  ("Best ETL for 2026?", "Am I making a mistake building on motherduck?") — they
   don't describe their pain, they shop for solutions.

  So picking up from CCI104, the priorities are:

  1. Stop hand-fixing ICPs — search agent needs to self-correct on 404s and
  zero-match cycles
  2. Fix learning/feedback loops in orchestrator.py
  3. Build real eval benchmark from the extracted data (8 Scaylor matches + 180
  August rejections + 9 CommunityWatch leads)
  4. Run end-to-end and measure precision

  What do you want me to start on?

● Here's what's happening across your 3 concurrent sessions:

  ---
  Current Sessions (Concurrent Group 1)

  This session (88e0a838) — "The Coordinator"

  Resumed from CCI104. Read the session, extracted benchmark data. Waiting for
  direction.

  Session B (95e16684) — "The Search Fixer"

  Resuming CCI103. Making the most edits (11 so far). Working on:
  - search.py — Rewrote the search prompt (identity-based queries vs
  topic-based)
  - orchestrator.py — Added failed community tracking (skip 404 subreddits),
  fixed feedback loop to tell search what went wrong, added subreddit validation
   before searching
  - test_august_fixed.py — Fixed communities list, updated reasoning model, then
   reverted the communities fix (per your "distributo has to figure it out"
  feedback — stopped hand-fixing)

  Your last instruction to it: "there's definitely way more field sales 
  people... if you run out of high intent, just find ICP... realize there is no 
  end to high intent, it's distributo's fault it's not finding those people"

  It said "yes" to a meta-prompt execution — currently implementing.

  Session C (c6914897) — "The Feedback Loop Fixer"

  Resuming CCI100-103. Only 2 edits so far, both to orchestrator.py:
  - Fixed the feedback loop — changed generic "search INDUSTRY forums" advice to
   actionable "use search_discussions to find conversations"
  - Changed feedback from "SEARCH more broadly" to "FIND THE PERSON" language

  Your assessment context: eval rejections are mostly correct (180 August
  rejections validated), the problem is search quality not eval quality.

  CONFLICT

  Both B and C are editing orchestrator.py. Their changes may overwrite each
  other. B has more edits (3 to orchestrator.py) vs C (2). They're both fixing
  the feedback loop — B is adding failed community tracking + subreddit
  validation, C is fixing the feedback language.

  Want me to diff their orchestrator.py changes to see if they conflict, or let
  them finish and merge?

● Here's the conflict analysis:

  Conflict Report: orchestrator.py

  782 lines changed total across both sessions. The file is heavily modified.

  Session B (95e16684) edited:

  1. _build_feedback progress section — Changed feedback text from "SEARCH more
  broadly" to zero-match escalation logic with platform switching, identity
  queries
  2. Community monitoring — Added failed_communities tracking so 404 subreddits
  get reported to search
  3. Compound learning section — Renamed/restructured the learning priming block
  4. MAX_CYCLES — Bumped or changed the cycles config

  Session C (c6914897) edited:

  1. _build_feedback inner lines — Changed "Search INDUSTRY forums" → "Use
  search_discussions", changed "SEARCH more broadly" → "FIND THE PERSON"
  2. _build_feedback rejection patterns — Changed pattern guidance text ("USE
  IDENTITY QUERIES" language)
  3. Rejection patterns — Renamed categories (VENDOR, BUILDER, WRONG_DOMAIN →
  NOT_A_PERSON, VENDOR, FALSE_POSITIVE, COACH_CONSULTANT)
  4. _store_learnings — Added match_profiles, reasoning_model_final,
  rejection_patterns storage
  5. Compound learning — Added full prior-learning priming (match examples,
  refined reasoning model, rejection warnings)
  6. Enrichment — Rewrote _enrich_candidates with 5-strategy cascade (LinkedIn
  title parsing, cross-platform Serper)
  7. _refine_reasoning_model — Added new method for mid-run reasoning model
  refinement
  8. Founder approval gate — Now shows reasoning model to founder for
  confirmation
  9. _parse_linkedin_title — New helper function at module level

  Overlap / Conflict:

  Yes, they conflicted on _build_feedback. Both sessions edited the same
  section:
  - B: Rewrote the zero-match escalation and changed feedback language
  - C: Also rewrote feedback language and added rejection pattern guidance

  The current state on disk is C's version (C wrote last — it has NOT_A_PERSON,
  VENDOR, FALSE_POSITIVE, COACH_CONSULTANT categories and the full escalation
  block). B's specific changes to the feedback text were likely overwritten by
  C.

  B's unique work that survived: community monitoring edits (earlier in the
  file), MAX_CYCLES change.

  C's much larger changes are all present: enrichment rewrite, compound
  learning, reasoning model refinement, LinkedIn parsing, founder gate.

  Bottom line: C won the conflict. C's changes are more comprehensive. B's
  feedback text edits were overwritten but B's structural changes (failed
  communities, MAX_CYCLES) appear intact since they're in different sections.
  The file is functional but messy — 782 lines of diff across multiple sessions.
