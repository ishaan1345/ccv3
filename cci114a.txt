     When working with files in `.claude/skills/`:

     ## SKILL.md Structure

     ```yaml
     ```

     ## DO
     - Keep SKILL.md concise (< 200 lines)
     - Include clear "When to Use" section
     - Provide copy-paste bash commands
     - Reference scripts/ for MCP operations
     - Add triggers to skill-rules.json

     ## DON'T
     - Include implementation details in SKILL.md
     - Duplicate content across skills
     - Create skills without corresponding trigger in skill-rules.json
     - Use allowed-tools that aren't needed

     ## MCP Wrapper Skills
     For skills that wrap MCP scripts:
     - Use `allowed-tools: [Bash, Read]` to restrict capabilities
     - Point to the script in scripts/ directory
     - Include parameter documentation

● Here's what happened in CCI111 and where it left off:

  What was built: The /team skill at .claude/skills/team/SKILL.md -- a
  multi-session coordination skill with 4 commands:
  - /team status - query PostgreSQL for active sessions, file claims, findings
  - /team review - read partner's work, challenge protocol
  - /team broadcast - share discoveries via findings table
  - /team delegate - assign work to pairs

  The journey: You asked for a /team skill to coordinate paired Claude Code
  sessions working on Distributo. The first version was too surface-level with a
   "signal hierarchy" taxonomy that was just vocab-swapping your insight. I
  rewrote it with specific bugs/line numbers, but you correctly called that out
  -- skills aren't one-time-use, specific bugs don't belong in a reusable
  coordination skill. The final version (current) is generic: how to work as a
  pair, the CTO test, engineering discipline, understanding your component.

  Where it stopped: Context limit hit right after the final rewrite was saved.
  You had asked me to "read what the other session is working on and oversee
  implementation." At that point:
  - Session 0d1c3fa0 (EVAL2) was deep in eval agent analysis
  - Session f31d65a7 was also rewriting the /team skill
  - Session d155d536 (originally EVAL1) had pivoted to comprehension work

  What still needs doing:
  1. The skill references /read-sessions (line 127) but that skill was renamed
  to /team -- dead reference
  2. Line 88 still has a Distributo-specific example ("What does a founder say?
  What ICP gets produced?") which contradicts the "make it generic" directive
  3. No actual verification that the PostgreSQL queries in the skill work (the
  findings table may not have all referenced columns)

  What do you want me to pick up on?

  but that was the version with specific bugs that got rewritten again to be
  generic.

  I'll give you the full synthesis once both agents finish reading the source
  code and compound report. They're still working through the large files.

● Here's the full picture:

  Distributo1 (4c3b3a1d) status:
  - Created directories for all 4 sub-skills: team/eval, team/comp, team/search,
   team/oversee
  - Only team/eval/SKILL.md is written so far (98 lines)
  - team/comp, team/search, team/oversee are empty directories -- still being
  written

  My assessment of what distributo1 wrote for team/eval:

  It's solid on the mechanics -- correct file paths, data flow diagram, batch
  size rationale, ground truth data locations, output format. But there are
  problems:

  1. It has specific bug details leaking in again. Line 76 references "CCI100"
  and specific precision numbers. The skill should explain the batch size
  decision without citing specific session numbers -- those are transient.
  2. It's missing the meta/skillchain aspect you asked about. The skill says
  "use /team status" and "use /team review" but doesn't automatically invoke
  them. You said the agent should activate these skills itself -- the skills
  should be chained so that when a session starts on eval, it automatically runs
   status, reads its partner, and bootstraps itself. Right now these are manual
  instructions.
  3. The main /team SKILL.md is unchanged from what CCI111 wrote. It still
  references /read-sessions on line 127 (dead reference -- that skill was
  renamed to /team). And line 88 still has Distributo-specific examples.
  4. team/comp, team/search, team/oversee are empty -- distributo1 is probably
  still writing them.

  What I think needs to happen (as distributo2/overseer):

  The skills need to be wired so that when a session starts working on eval, it
  doesn't just read instructions -- it automatically:
  - Runs /team status to see what's happening
  - Reads its partner's latest messages
  - Reads the actual source code
  - Only THEN starts working

  That's the "meta/skillchain" you're describing -- not a passive document but
  an active bootstrap sequence. Should I write the oversee skill and the
  skill-chaining logic while distributo1 finishes the component skills? Or do
  you want me to intervene on what distributo1 is writing first?

✻ Crunched for 1m 16s

● Agent "Read current Distributo agents" completed

● Both agents are done. I now have the full picture. Here's my assessment as
  distributo2/overseer:

  ---
  State of play across all sessions:
  Session: 4c3b3a1d
  Role: distributo1
  Status: Writing skills
  What it did: Created team/eval SKILL.md (98 lines). comp, search, oversee
    directories created but empty -- still writing
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Session: 2b646e1d
  Role: distributo2 (me)
  Status: Reading/overseeing
  What it did: Read compound report, all source code, all active sessions
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Session: 8918c3fc
  Role: EVAL1
  Status: Building benchmark
  What it did: Edited test_eval_benchmark.py with real Scaylor/August data
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Session: f30d428d
  Role: CCI digest
  Status: Completed
  What it did: Built /cci-digest skill, generated 315-line compound report from
    20 sessions
  My assessment of what distributo1 is building:

  The team/eval skill it wrote is a good reference document -- correct data
  flow, file paths, batch size rationale, ground truth locations. But it has the
   problems I flagged: it's still a passive document with session-number
  citations, not an active skill that chains into action.

  What you're asking for -- and what's missing:

  You want the skills to be activated by the agent automatically --
  skill-chained. When a session starts on eval, the skill should trigger a
  sequence:
  1. Auto-run /team status
  2. Auto-read partner's latest work
  3. Auto-read the actual source file
  4. Then start working

  Right now the skills just say "you should do X" -- they don't make it happen.
  The /team parent skill and the component sub-skills are instruction manuals,
  not automation.

  What I'll do: Write the team/oversee skill since that's my role, and make it
  the one that actually orchestrates -- reads all sessions, checks what each
  pair is doing, broadcasts assignments, and skill-chains the component skills
  when bootstrapping a new pair. I'll also review and correct what distributo1
  writes for comp and search once it finishes those.

  Should I start writing team/oversee now, or wait for distributo1 to finish the
   other component skills first so I can review the full set together?

❯ cool, go.

  (comp, search, eval) are solid -- they describe the right data flows, file
  paths, and downstream dependencies. The oversee skill has a bootstrap
  sequence.

  But the core problem remains: These are passive documents. The user wants
  skill-chaining -- when you invoke /team eval, the agent should automatically 
  execute the bootstrap, not just read instructions. And the oversee skill
  should chain into the component skills when bootstrapping pairs.

  Let me rewrite oversee to be the active orchestration skill, and tighten the
  component skills' bootstrap sections to be imperative.

● Update(.claude/skills/team/oversee/SKILL.md)
  ⎿  PreToolUse:Edit says: # Skill Development Rules

     When working with files in `.claude/skills/`:

     ## SKILL.md Structure

     ```yaml
     ```

     ## DO
     - Keep SKILL.md concise (< 200 lines)
     - Include clear "When to Use" section
     - Provide copy-paste bash commands
     - Reference scripts/ for MCP operations
     - Add triggers to skill-rules.json

     ## DON'T
     - Include implementation details in SKILL.md
     - Duplicate content across skills
     - Create skills without corresponding trigger in skill-rules.json
     - Use allowed-tools that aren't needed

     ## MCP Wrapper Skills
     For skills that wrap MCP scripts:
     - Use `allowed-tools: [Bash, Read]` to restrict capabilities
     - Point to the script in scripts/ directory
     - Include parameter documentation

     When working with files in `.claude/skills/`:

     ## SKILL.md Structure

     ```yaml
     ```

     ## DO
     - Keep SKILL.md concise (< 200 lines)
     - Include clear "When to Use" section
     - Provide copy-paste bash commands
     - Reference scripts/ for MCP operations
     - Add triggers to skill-rules.json

     ## DON'T
     - Include implementation details in SKILL.md
     - Duplicate content across skills
     - Create skills without corresponding trigger in skill-rules.json
     - Use allowed-tools that aren't needed

     ## MCP Wrapper Skills
     For skills that wrap MCP scripts:
     - Use `allowed-tools: [Bash, Read]` to restrict capabilities
     - Point to the script in scripts/ directory
     - Include parameter documentation

● Distributo1 already added bootstrap sections to the eval skill (and the
  others) while I was reading. They're structured as "DO THIS FIRST" with bash
  commands. The structure is there but it says "Run ALL of these before you
  start working" -- passive. Let me make it imperative and add the
  partner-explanation gate.

  Current state:

  Active sessions (Group 1):

  Doing: Wrote all 4 component skills
  Edits: SKILL.md
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Session: 2b646e1d

  Doing: Rewrote oversee, tightened bootstraps
  Edits: SKILL.md

  Edits: none
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Session: d155d536
  Role: COMPREHENSION1
  Doing: Edited comprehension.py, eval.py, orchestrator.py, tools.py
  Edits: 4 files
  SKILL.md conflict: 3 sessions touched it (me, distributo1, f30d428d). Since
  distributo1 and I were coordinating on the same edits, this is resolved -- my
  edits built on top of its work.

  Key findings broadcast:
  - EVAL1 wrote a benchmark with 22 candidates (11 August, 6 Scaylor, 4
  Restaurant, 3 degraded). Waiting for EVAL2 review.
  - Distributo1 wrote all 4 component skills.
  - I tightened all bootstrap sections to be imperative + added the
  partner-explanation gate.

  What's done:
  - /team parent skill (generic coordination protocol)
  - /team eval (eval context + auto-bootstrap)
  - /team comp (comprehension context + auto-bootstrap)
  - /team search (search context + auto-bootstrap)
  - /team oversee (active orchestration with skill-chaining)
  - All bootstraps now have "EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY" + Step 4 GATE (explain to
  partner before coding)

  What still needs attention:
  1. EVAL2 (0d1c3fa0) hasn't written code yet -- needs to review EVAL1's
  benchmark
  2. The Distributo codebase has 1811 uncommitted insertions across 7 files from
   old sessions (Groups 2-4) -- that's a merge risk
  3. working_on fields in PostgreSQL are all empty -- sessions aren't
  self-registering their role
  4. The older session groups (2-4) have serious file conflicts on
  orchestrator.py and tools.py that were never resolved

❯ SO NOW HOW DO I USE TEAM AND BUILD DISTRIBUTO CORRECTLY?  

● Here's the workflow:

  ---
  How to Use /team to Build Distributo

  Setup: 3-4 terminal windows, 2 sessions each

  Window 1: Comprehension pair
  - Session A: /team comp → auto-bootstraps, reads source, reads partner
  - Session B: /team comp → same bootstrap, sees Session A's work

  Window 2: Search pair
  - Session A: /team search → auto-bootstraps
  - Session B: /team search

  Window 3: Eval pair
  - Session A: /team eval → auto-bootstraps
  - Session B: /team eval

  Window 4: You + Overseer
  - Session A: You, giving direction
  - Session B: /team oversee → auto-reads all sessions, assesses, delegates

  What happens when a session loads /team eval:

  1. It executes the bootstrap -- runs status queries, reads findings, reads
  eval.py line by line, reads partner's messages, checks git diff
  2. It hits the GATE -- must explain to its partner what eval does and what it
  plans to change before writing any code
  3. Partner challenges: "what invariant does this preserve? show me a real
  input."
  4. Code gets written. Partner runs /team review.
  5. If the change affects what downstream receives, session runs /team 
  broadcast so other pairs know.

  The overseer's loop:

  The overseer session runs /team oversee, which auto-executes:
  1. Reads all active sessions
  2. Checks for file conflicts
  3. Reads each pair's latest messages
  4. Assesses: are pairs aligned? stuck? conflicting?
  5. Acts: delegates tasks, resolves conflicts, nudges stuck pairs
  6. When bootstrapping a new pair, tells it which component skill to invoke

  What you do:

  You sit in Window 4 and give high-level direction. The overseer translates
  your intent into specific task assignments via /team delegate. The pairs
  execute with deep understanding because the component skills loaded them with
  the full context -- data flow, contracts, what downstream needs, what upstream
   gives.

  Before any of this -- clean up the codebase:

  Right now there are 1811 uncommitted lines across 7 Distributo files from old
  sessions. Multiple sessions from Groups 2-4 have conflicting edits to
  orchestrator.py and tools.py that were never resolved. Before spinning up
  fresh pairs:

  1. Review the uncommitted diff in Distributo -- decide what to keep
  2. Commit or stash the good changes
  3. Start fresh pairs on a clean working tree

  Otherwise every new session's bootstrap will see a massive diff and get
  confused about what's current vs stale.

  The actual build sequence:

  Phase 1: Stabilize what exists
  - Comp pair: Verify comprehension produces good ICPs with real founder input.
  The extraction prompt and reasoning_model quality are the foundation.
  - Search pair: Understand both search paths (AI agent vs mechanical). The
  orchestrator bypasses the search agent after cycle 1 -- figure out if that's
  still the right call.
  - Eval pair: EVAL1 already wrote a benchmark with 22 real candidates. EVAL2
  needs to review it and run it. This gives you a regression guard before any
  prompt changes.

  Phase 2: Fix the plumbing
  - The enrichment cascade has silent failures -- most candidates hit "limited"
  quality. This is the #1 lever for precision.
  - Community verification -- comprehension hallucinate subreddit names. Need
  Reddit API check before adding to ICP.
  - Feedback loop -- does eval rejection feedback actually change search
  behavior in cycle 2+?

  Phase 3: Validate end-to-end
  - Run August and Scaylor through the full pipeline
  - Compare results against the benchmark
  - Is precision above 60%? Above 90%? What's the gap?

  Each phase uses the paired sessions with the challenge protocol. No phase
  starts until the previous one's output is validated with real data -- not
  tests with hand-crafted inputs.

  OVERSEER ASSESSMENT

  Step 2: Assess

  Session Map:
  Session: 4c3b3a1d
  Role: distributo1 (co-overseer)
  Edits: SKILL.md
  Status: Active. Wrote skills, now waiting. Was told "don't touch code,
    oversee."
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Session: 2b646e1d
  Role: distributo2 (me, overseer)
  Edits: SKILL.md
  Status: Active. Rewrote bootstraps, executing oversee protocol.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Session: 8918c3fc
  Role: EVAL1
  Edits: test_eval_benchmark.py
  Status: Benchmark written with 22 real candidates. Waiting for EVAL2 review.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Session: 0d1c3fa0
  Role: EVAL2
  Edits: none
  Status: STALE. Last action was setting up digest infrastructure. Never
  reviewed
     EVAL1's benchmark despite being assigned.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Session: d155d536
  Role: COMPREHENSION1
  Edits: comprehension.py, eval.py, orchestrator.py, tools.py
  Status: Done. 1811 lines of real fixes from CCI108. This is the bulk of
    uncommitted work.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Session: d32ae740
  Role: Digest runner
  Edits: compound-report.md
  Status: Running a new CCI digest.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Session: 087f95b7
  Role: Digest builder
  Edits: compound-report.md
  Status: Completed the original compound report.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Session: f30d428d
  Role: Skill/CCI-digest creator
  Edits: SKILL.md + instruction files
  Status: Created /cci-digest skill. Done.
  File Conflicts:
  - SKILL.md: 3 sessions (me, distributo1, f30d428d) -- RESOLVED. All skill
  edits are coordinated.
  - compound-report.md: 2 sessions -- harmless, both are digest runs.
  - Groups 3-4 (older): tools.py (3 sessions), orchestrator.py (4 sessions
  across groups) -- STALE CONFLICTS from prior work. All absorbed into
  d155d536's 1811-line diff.

  Critical Issues:

  1. EVAL2 is stuck/stale. Assigned to review EVAL1's benchmark but hasn't
  acted. Analysis paralysis.
  2. No search pair active. Nobody is working on search.py or tools.py.
  3. No comp pair active. Nobody is working on comprehension.py.
  4. 1811 uncommitted lines need committing. These are real fixes from
  COMPREHENSION1 but they're sitting as a dirty working tree. Every new
  session's bootstrap sees this massive diff and wastes time understanding it.
  5. Pipeline hasn't been run end-to-end since all these changes. Nobody knows
  if precision improved or degraded.

  Step 3: Act

  Immediate actions needed from you:

  1. Commit the 1811 lines. COMPREHENSION1's work (d155d536) includes real bug
  fixes: eval prompt rewrite, enrichment cascade, mechanical search, compound
  learning, LinkedIn title parsing. This needs to be committed so pairs start
  from a clean baseline. Want me to prepare a commit?
  2. Nudge EVAL2 or accept that it's stale. It was assigned to review EVAL1's
  benchmark and hasn't moved. Either poke that terminal or let EVAL1 self-review
   and move on.
  3. Spin up missing pairs. You have eval covered (EVAL1 + EVAL2). You need:
    - A search pair -- two terminals, each runs /team search
    - A comp pair -- two terminals, each runs /team comp
  4. Run the pipeline. After committing, someone needs to run August and Scaylor
   end-to-end to see where precision stands after all these changes. That's the
  only real validation.

  What do you want me to do first?

● You're right. I only mapped the sessions in Group 1 (the most recent). Groups
  2-4 have the sessions that actually did the heavy implementation work on
  Distributo components. Let me map ALL of them.

    Fixed orchestrator issues.
  ---
  What each component's sessions actually accomplished:

  Comprehension: d155d536 (COMPREHENSION1) did the bulk -- edited
  comprehension.py with the 2-phase interview + extraction, fixed subreddit
  hallucination handling.

  Search: d0b59ea4 (SEARCH1) + 6c9a15b3 (SEARCH2/ARCHITECT) -- tools.py rewrite,
   scraping research, platform expansion beyond Reddit. 3f22678f also edited
  search.py with bug fixes.

  Eval: d155d536 rewrote the eval prompt (topic-matching → identity-matching).
  8918c3fc (EVAL1) wrote the benchmark. 0d1c3fa0 (EVAL2) assessed but wrote no
  code.

  Orchestrator: 7dd2d82c + 88e0a838 + 3f22678f + 6c9a15b3 all edited
  orchestrator.py -- enrichment cascade, mechanical search, compound learning,
  feedback loops, bug fixes. This is where the conflict chaos was.

  The 1811 uncommitted lines represent the MERGED result of all these sessions' 
  work -- primarily from d155d536 which consolidated the fixes.

  That's the real map. Not 3 sessions -- 15 sessions across 4 groups, with the
  implementation work concentrated in Groups 3-4.

  What It Actually Did: Deep eval assessment, no code written
  Exported As: (active)
  What I got wrong: I was labeling sessions as "COMPREHENSION1" and "SEARCH1"
  when you never assigned those roles. Only 8918c3fc and 0d1c3fa0 were
  explicitly told they were EVAL1/EVAL2. Every other session was given the full
  system and told "read everything and fix it." The component-pair model (/team 
  eval, /team comp, /team search) is what you WANT to do going forward -- it
  wasn't what was happening before.

  The actual lineage:
  CCI104 → 88e0a838 → CCI106
  CCI104-106 → 7dd2d82c → CCI107
  CCI106 → 3f22678f → CCI108
  CCI104-106 → 6c9a15b3 → CCI110
  CCI107 → d0b59ea4 → CCI110
  CCI108 → d155d536 → (uncommitted, most recent state)

  The uncommitted 1811 lines in Distributo are from d155d536 building on top of 
  CCI108, which built on CCI106/107, which built on CCI104-106. It's a chain,
  not isolated sessions.

❯ most recent is cci 111-113 so waht are you talking abo. well actually the 
  entirety of cci is a chain. /team oversee correctly.                      

● You're right. The entire CCI history is a chain -- CCI1 through CCI113. I've
  been treating sessions as isolated groups when they're all part of one
  continuous project. And the most recent work is CCI111-113, not the old
  CCI104-108 sessions I keep referencing.

  Let me actually find CCI112 and CCI113 -- I haven't read those at all.

● Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● CCI112a and CCI113a exist and I never read them. These are the most recent
  sessions. Let me read them now -- they're what's actually current.

● 2 scout agents launched (ctrl+o to expand)
   ├─ Read CCI112a fully
   │  ⎿  Running in the background (↓ to manage)
   └─ Read CCI113a fully
      ⎿  Running in the background (↓ to manage)

● While those read, let me also check -- which sessions are CCI112a and CCI113a?
   They were exported from specific session IDs.

● Read 2 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● So:
  - CCI112a = ran /cci-digest on CCI110 -- it's a digest/analysis session
  - CCI113a = resumed CCI108 -- this is an implementation session that continued
   the bug-fixing work

  Let me also map which active sessions correspond to which CCI exports. The
  active sessions in Group 1 are the CURRENT ones.

● I see CCI112a and CCI113a were exported from sessions that already closed --
  they don't appear in the active JSONL list. They're the sessions that ran
  /cci-digest on CCI110 and resumed CCI108 respectively, both exported and
  closed.

  Let me wait for the agents to finish reading them, then I'll have the complete
   chain and can give you a correct overseer assessment.

● Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● Both still working through the large files. While waiting -- you said the
  entirety of CCI is a chain. That means the correct way to see this is:

  CCI1 → CCI2 → ... → CCI104 → CCI105 → CCI106 → CCI107 → CCI108 → CCI110 →
  CCI111 → CCI112a → CCI113a

  And the currently active sessions (4c3b3a1d, 2b646e1d, 8918c3fc, 0d1c3fa0,
  d155d536, etc.) are all CCI114+ essentially -- they're the sessions that
  haven't been exported yet but are continuing the chain.

  I'll give you the corrected overseer report once the agents finish reading
  CCI112a and CCI113a. Those are the most recent context and I should have read
  them first instead of re-reading old sessions.

✻ Baked for 5m 0s

● Agent "Read CCI112a fully" completed

● Read 2 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● CCI113a agent still running. CCI112a is done though. Here's what I now know:

  CCI112a = session 087f95b7 = SEARCH1 (the one I misidentified as "digest 
  builder")
  - Told: "work on search capabilities, coordinate with search2"
  - Did: Architecture analysis, tool consolidation proposal, Haiku pre-filter
  debate (rejected), signal extraction discussion
  - Zero code edits. Hit context limit before writing anything.
  - Key finding: Crawl4AI IS installed. 4 dead tools identified. Most search
  tools are just search_serper with different site: filters.

  So my earlier map was wrong -- 087f95b7 wasn't a "digest builder." It was
  SEARCH1 for the current round. And d0b59ea4 from Group 3 was the earlier
  SEARCH1 (now renamed SEARCH2 in this context).

  Waiting on CCI113a to complete, then I'll give the corrected full chain.

✻ Cogitated for 4m 52s

● Agent "Read CCI113a fully" completed

● Now I have the real picture. Here's the corrected chain and overseer
  assessment:

  THE ACTUAL CCI CHAIN (111-113)
  CCI: CCI111
  Session: 69d8737a
  Role: Built /team skill
  What It Did: Deep Distributo analysis, wrote/rewrote team skill 3 times, user
    pushed for deeper understanding
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  CCI: CCI112a
  Session: 087f95b7
  Role: SEARCH1
  What It Did: Search architecture analysis, tool consolidation proposal, Haiku
    pre-filter rejected, Crawl4AI found installed. 0 code edits -- hit
     context limit.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  CCI: CCI113a
  Session: d155d536
  Role: COMPREHENSION1
  What It Did: The real workhorse. Reverted CCI108's artificial constraints
    (comment filter, pre-eval keyword gate). Fixed 2 real enrichment
    bugs (LinkedIn login wall, title parser location detection).
    Validated ALL components. Implemented identity_signals in
    comprehension + detected_signals in eval. 1811 lines uncommitted.
  What I Got Wrong Earlier

  1. Called 087f95b7 a "digest builder" -- it's SEARCH1 (CCI112a)
  2. Called d155d536 "COMPREHENSION1 from CCI108" -- it IS COMPREHENSION1 but
  it's CCI113a, the most recent implementation session
  3. Didn't read CCI112a/113a at all until you told me
  4. Kept treating sessions as isolated groups instead of one continuous chain
  5. The 1811 uncommitted lines aren't "old work from Groups 2-4" -- they're
  from CCI113a, the most recent session, which:
    - Reverted bad fixes (artificial char-length filters, pre-eval keyword
  gates)
    - Added real fixes (LinkedIn enrichment, comment context with parent post
  titles)
    - Implemented identity_signals end-to-end (comprehension extracts them, eval
   detects them in match text)
    - Validated every component: dedup, memory, ICP, eval, comprehension, tools,
   enrichment

  Current State (Corrected)

  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Session: d155d536
  Role: COMPREHENSION1 (CCI113a)
  Status: Done. 1811 lines of real work uncommitted.
  What actually needs to happen:
  1. CCI113a's 1811 lines need to be committed -- it's validated, real work
  2. SEARCH1 needs to restart and actually write code (it spent its entire
  context on analysis)
  3. EVAL1's benchmark needs to be run against the current eval (which CCI113a
  already rewrote)
  4. Nobody has run the full pipeline end-to-end since CCI113a's changes

  What Changed Since My Last Report

  1. EVAL2 is no longer stale. It's now editing eval.py and
  test_eval_component.py. Working.
  2. SEARCH2 (d32ae740) is the real surprise. It fixed 7 bugs in orchestrator.py
   AND started Crawl4AI integration. But it also replaced the bigram signal
  extraction heuristic with a Haiku API call -- user is skeptical this is
  correct.
  3. COMP1 (f30d428d) is raising a fundamental question: Does the comprehension
  agent capture what the founder actually knows, or what Opus thinks sounds
  right? This is the right question to ask. No validation yet.
  4. SEARCH1 (6f71f4bb) is waiting -- loaded /team search, ready to test once
  SEARCH2 finishes Crawl4AI.
  5. COMP2 (5e12b67d) barely started -- loaded /team comp then stalled.

  Critical Risks

  1. SEARCH2's Haiku signal extraction change. The bigram heuristic found "72
  cents/mile" which unlocked the 6/8 match success. Replacing it with Haiku
  might break what works. User already flagged skepticism.
  2. COMP1's design question is valid but could become analysis paralysis. The
  comprehension agent works well enough to produce ICPs that eval can use. The
  question is whether it can be better, not whether it should be thrown out.
  3. Multiple sessions editing the same files. SEARCH2 editing orchestrator.py +
   tools.py while CCI113a's 1811 lines are still uncommitted on disk. These will
   conflict.
  4. Still no end-to-end pipeline run. Every pair is building/fixing their
  component. Nobody has run August or Scaylor through the full chain to see if
  precision is better or worse after all these changes.

  What Each Pair Should Do Next

  - Eval pair: EVAL2 is writing code -- good. Run the benchmark against the
  current eval prompt.
  - Search pair: SEARCH1 should test the pipeline NOW with what exists, before
  SEARCH2's Crawl4AI is done. Get a baseline.
  - Comp pair: COMP1 should run comprehension on real founder input and compare
  output to what the founder actually said. Answer the question empirically, not
   philosophically.
  - Overseer: The biggest risk is divergent uncommitted changes across sessions.
   Someone needs to own the git state.
