❯  hey so i have to build a qa functionality agent. It has to go through    
  the UI August, which is the company I work for. It's a build sales        
  intelligence                                                              
    platform that automatically updates your CRM surface is all the signals 
   it's kind of gone, but for outside sales and gong so anyway the point    
  I'm making                                                                
    is that I have to make a bash script, executable sort of thing that     
  functions like an agent like a person like a user of August and           
  essentially just be                                                       
    able to tell if there's anything wrong or what all the bugs are pretty  
  much because we're very much early and there's a lot of bugs and our      
  users wanna     be able to use without any bugs and this is supposed to   
  be something where you can find it at any URL not just August butpeople   
  are essentially going  to use it too test August prod dev web app mobile  
  app desktop app and so we have to figure out how all that works. The      
  minimum viable agent here is         something that can test the web app  
  so using like a skill like the browser or basically becoming a browser us 
   agentand that is how we can test this so                                 
    what time should we have a lot of bugs and we want to have a user go    
  through it and look at it after every bug or after every deploy or after  
  whatever      and so that sounds gonna work here. think about what im     
  saying and get back to me. this sis a professional task i need to embark  
  on. i need you to fully                                                   
    create the agent that works in literally 1 day. lets think about what   
  ways tere are to do this. my boss wants a bash script executable type of  
               thing.Transcript[Pasted text #1] so this was our entire      
  conversation. what can you extrapolate? i need you to use maximum thining 
   effor tot try and                                                        
    create this but also ideate everyhting needed and eveyr single thing    
  needed to build this and what it entails.     want, you can use it for    
  hosting. You can do all that. And so basically, I said that up            
  originally, but it's not super scalable. Like no sequel is like, not      
  ideal, but it's fine. I' I'm gonna get you off the ground. But so now, as 
   we've built out the team, we started building out a lot more users. We   
  are trying to migrate everything to booze grass. Yeah on Neon. And so,    
  and actually, have I invited you to Neon? I haven't. I don't think so.    
  But I guess I didn't check, really. I don't no, I'm 90% sure I didn't. I  
  think P created your account, so he definitely wouldn't have done this.   
  Okay. Um.. Okay, you have been invited. Um, and let me know if I start    
  describing, like, parts of the platform that you're like, oh, uh. you     
  know, I don't have access to that. Let me know. And I'll invite you to    
  it. Okay. So basically, August the other thing that you should get access 
   to is century. Century is what we use for like issue logging. Okay. And  
  do I need like paragon access or anything? Uh, yeah, you can get paragon  
  access at some point. That's less important in the short term. Yeah. a    
  short term, you are going to work on QA work, so I'll stick to the        
  platforms that are more important for that. We can, I guess paradons.     
  Yeah, I guess paragon will be helpful to make sure that things are wrong  
  so we can do that. Okay. Let's see. Do you remember., obviouslyviously,   
  on these platforms, please don't touch anything, but, uh, you know, we    
  can kind of go through how you can use them for your QA work blows. Okay. 
   So, have we ever given you like a product tour or anything? Yeah, just   
  yesterday. Christian gave us the tour. Did he add you as a user? Um,      
  yeah, I just signed up for my account, so that's what you're talking      
  about, right? August? Yeah, on August, yeah. Okay. And I just downloaded  
  all the different versions. And then I also add you to as a dev user.     
  Okay. Um, which is basically just the same thing. I agree. one circle     
  It's how it goes. Yeah.. Jeez. Okay. So, basically what I'm supposed to   
  be able to do is, I'm not going to add you right now because I don't know 
   if it's gonna work, and I don't want to deal with this breaking. Okay.   
  I'm a short term. Yeah. Okay. So, you know, at a high level, and this is  
  kind of the good, bad part. Like, is a small company, you know, we have   
  an iPhone app, Android app, which we're on Flut. So there's at least one  
  platform for that, which is generally nice. Okay. And like releases and   
  everything are fucking pain. So we have both of those, then we have a     
  desktop app, and now we have desktop for PC and Mac. Okay. And we have    
  the smartwatch app or Apple, and we're probably going to have the         
  smartwatch app for Samsung or PC soon. Yeah. Okay. Um, so we're just      
  trying to maintain a lot, and so this fireb migration is a bit of a pain  
  because we're trying to there's some stuff that's written only in         
  postcress.. So we're trying to basically like read from Firebase for      
  certain things. Yeah. And then we have to migrate everything, but again,  
  now we have like migration timing issues because like the web is easy. We 
   can just deploy the web and everyone's using the new one. Yeah. But with 
   mobile, we have to make sure that like, you know, we have to get fucking 
   approved by Apple, approved by Android, and then everyone has to         
  migrate, we have this like annoying time period where we have to get      
  support both. So right now we basically have the two databases trying to  
  stay in sync for certain things. Oh, yeah. It's just causing issues. And  
  as we basically are onboarding more users and people, this is like        
  cascading issues. Exponential. Sure. Yeah. So that is one of the big      
  things that we are dealing with right now. So basically, what would be    
  like what would be ideal and what I want to start you want is kind of     
  building out a proper QA, like UI, QA process. Okay. Because as we deploy 
   code, like, we do have like CICD workflows for all of it, which is       
  great. Okay. But we also, you know, do want to check. Like a lot of this  
  UI stuff ends up, you know, being like, hey, Jamie, can you do this? Hey, 
   you know, Kumar, can you do that? Can you test this? Okay. So it sounds  
  like you have some familiarity with playwright and MCP., I guess,         
  playwright, whatever. Yeah. Playwright. Yeah, playwright. Okay. It uses a 
   lot of context. So, I mean, I'm thinking I could probably just build an  
  agent that does the QA. Okay. Because basically what we're going to want  
  is like something that. So right now, another fun thing is that, like, we 
   only have Deb and Broad. Okay. We should also add a staging environment  
  as well, and then we can use the use the agent to basically QA on         
  staging. Okay. Yeah, sure. That makes sense. So, um, do you have the      
  desktop app installed? Um, I should, yes, I believe I did install it. Let 
   me just check.. I'm actually gonna record this meeting and feel free to  
  do the same, but I can all share the conversation with you. But like in   
  this meeting, what I'd like to do is go through like the pieces, like the 
   cute, the workflows that I want the agent to test. Okay. So let me know  
  when you have the desktop app starting to record. Give me one second.     
  Cheers. You can also download it from the website. Yeah, I think I got    
  the DMG pile. Oh, I guess I didn't download it. Okay. Safari has been     
  weird, too. I just in the beginning. All right? Okay, cool, sorry. All    
  right, so do you have a recording? If not, don't worry, I'll just send    
  you this recording. Okay, cool, thank you. So, um, at least go through    
  that should be a little more stable. So we'll start with Web. QA for now. 
   All right. I'm assuming we can't use playwright or mobile, right? No,    
  modern Web app. Okay.. I don't think so. I mean, there must be some way   
  to use an agent. I can look into it. I can look into it. Yeah, I mean,    
  well, see, I don't know. Obviously, you can run a simulator in your       
  computer and, you know, clod in whatever has computer use. So, like, it   
  would be doable, but we'll figure it out. Okay. Yeah, that's probably the 
   use. Well, I would say that we'll go through like key work blows here.   
  Okay.ly for every version, right? You want to do QA for every single      
  version of the app. Eventually, but we'll start with Web. So just today,  
  you know, to short term, it focuses Web, and we'll build out the rest,    
  because each of them knew slightly different things. And like, watch and  
  whatever, like, you'll see, doesn't really do much. So, we have our tabs. 
   So the most important one is going to be conversations. So within here,  
  you know, we'd probably want to check, you know, hey, is it displaying my 
   conversations as I expect? Web can't record conversations, so there's    
  nothing to worry about there. And then we also want to make sure that     
  Team is showing team conversations. So, you know, we'll use an account    
  that has team members. So ideally, you know, we just want to check like I 
   was a, you know, do we have team members available, right? Right.        
  Assuming we have that, we're in pretty good shape. Okay. Well, then we    
  can click into a given conversation here. So these are all internal. Just 
   sink into our company. So obviously we'd want to verify that like this   
  loads without errors. We can do, I guess, some things like, you know,     
  we'd want to verify that we're rettagging speakers so I can make Jason    
  and Jason Batson. you know, on Ian S. Awesome. Okay, so for instance,     
  like here we're having a collision with retag speakers. Okay. And the     
  audio player, which I think is fixed in one of the bugs, but whatever. So 
   right now, it's not fixed. So if you want to verify that if I do this,   
  is this function? I'm going to work? Yeah. Hopefully it does cloud        
  function, upgrade. I'll to update the speaker names, via cloud function,  
  so that's not great. But I'm 90% sure.. But this is what I need to find.  
  Like this is what the QA pod is supposed to find. Yeah, so renam          
  remapping superior speaker error. All right. So it allegedly says it in   
  progress. So someone is working on it. All right. But, you know, stuff    
  like that. Sure. I also want to make sure that this is worked on, but     
  basically these highlights are supposed to show colors and they are not   
  showing colors. Mm hmm. The highlight? Oh. Okay, so.. My lights. Okay...  
  Sorry, I'm just trying to do a good bit of a lot of things this morning.  
  Okay, yeah, no problem. I know. So that's why I'm just trying to blaze    
  through a ton of this. Yeah, no problem. But I'm kind of working as we    
  go. Sure. Christian and I were both out for conferences last week, so     
  we're both a little behind. Gotcha. But basically, you know, you'd want   
  to double check. You know, have a click through these, you know, is it    
  displaying me just correctly, simple stuff, right? And transcript, I      
  guess, verify that something displays here, you don't really have to go   
  through it. Okay. Insights, there's no fine insights because there was no 
   client, so it's fine. And then, you know, we just want to verify the     
  coaching tab worked and you can always just have it click on a deep dive  
  just so it can deep dive into a section on the coaching page. Otherwise   
  it should be pretty straightforward. And then from within here, probably  
  in, you know, I guess you can have it like tick and take action on and    
  make sure it works. Sure. Just use it as user, yeah. And one of the key   
  things is syncing CRM, so hopefully this is still working because this is 
   broken ort bad shape. We're onboarding today, but I can link is to U. I  
  do the same with deals. Simple. Un technically tag people. just doesn't   
  really matter quite as much. Okay. Jamie and August, easy. Yeah. And      
  then, you know, I can test, you know, try to do a sync and we want to see 
   if action items and conversation summaries sync. So basically what we do 
   is we see, okay, great, this showed correctly. Now I'm going to go to    
  our hubspot, which is here, maybe. Here we go. Perfect. Follow up with    
  Jason about team meeting details. Sounds perfect. That's So I could go    
  inhere to meetings and bam with this meeting showed up, and that's great. 
   Okay, so you wanted to the agent told to do all this, what you're doing, 
   right? Yeah, we'd want the agent to also in theory, go to Hubspot and    
  confirm that, like, you know, these were you can just sync everything to  
  this fake company that.. So that would probably be so that's probably,    
  you know, the conversation blow. Okay. And then we'd also want to do a    
  few things like, oh, sorry, I'm back in death. That' Fuck. That's not     
  good. So, you know, it's good that the badges show up great. You know,    
  then you can have a creative fake company, right? And like in this case,  
  like, it really doesn't matter if it creates, you know, just have it      
  create like T- strong, test, co, you know, 20, 20, six, 09. All right.    
  And, you know, I give it a domain. Sure. You just want to make sure, and  
  then we'll of the same thing, like, verify that Ishan Test code, you      
  know, it shows up here, great, you know, we want to go back to pub spots, 
   to the same time. Okay. But you know, go to Hubspots, assume that Ion    
  have Ishan test Kara shows up. I mean, maybe maybe they better way to do  
  it is like create a company and create a contact. Like create a deal So   
  you'd go through all of these pages.. You know, creating companies,       
  contacts, and deals. So create E1 and then have it like link the latest   
  conversation to those and then verify that, you know, it got synced       
  properly. Okay. Because then that covers everything on Web, and then on   
  the overview tab, we' probably just want to make sure that, like, this    
  displays, right? So, hey, you can see this, you know, I guess, have it    
  select a specific rep to give feedback on how is Jamiei doing? Oh, look   
  at that. He had a peek, and now I'm coming down. What.. But, you know,    
  this is mostly working. Okay. And then we have these AI takeaways, which  
  basically, these are kind of nifty, but basically depending on like what  
  you've selected, basically going to show it will rejig. So like if you    
  have a team of five people, you can get your full team, but let's say I   
  was just like, oh, I want to see how Ishan's doing. I can go to the Ishan 
   page and have a generate. Right. And it can generate. So whatever. This  
  coaching report. There we go. Yeah. It starts to generate a coaching      
  report for Jeanie. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I saw this. Way to coach him. So,    
  same thing. And then I can go to objections. Basically the same thing,    
  right? Oh, you know, what are we seeing here? What are you talking about? 
   How are we dealing with it? Stuff like that? And that's probably, I      
  guess, the whole web, you could also just have it, maybe what you should  
  do is on here. If you mark something as important, right? Like Jason      
  Hatch the CM, if you Jason K Kumar work on a call, I this is all, you     
  know, I mean, so the most part, it's nice that it's pretty. hopefully a   
  decent job of creating these, but, for instance, if I go to Toodoo's now, 
   I can see, oh, these were all in here. So like Ishan 2 begin writing QA  
  tests, so I can be like, great, that's done. So we want to make sure that 
   that gets, you know, marked properly in no due date, great. Right. Like  
  that shows up correctly. So. Pretty simple. And that would be the full    
  web platform you. Yeah. That makes sense. There's also the piece about    
  like connecting and disconnecting the CRM, but I think we probably want   
  to do that manually because that's a bigger thing to fuck up. So maybe we 
   can just make sure that that's working manually. Okay. So at least with  
  what we've done today does that give you kind of a decent starting place? 
   Yeah, I think that's a pretty good starting place. So, just a question.  
  How deep do you want it to go? Like, do you want it to be able to tell if 
   certain like insights are wrong or just that No, it doesn't have the QA  
  any of that right now. Like it's more of like a functionality QA. Ah. It  
  just make sure, you know, have it like generate a random company, random  
  person, blah, blah, blah. Make sure they all get created. We want to      
  verify that those are created, you know, in hubspot. And we, for          
  instance, then, like, you probably manually have to, just talk to your    
  phone, you know, for two minutes. Like just talk to your phone for a      
  minute, have it generate a new conversation. Yeah. Once that conversation 
   gets uploaded, you know, then you can have run it and just have it, you  
  know, select the latest conversation and then have it run that flow,      
  right? Syn that conversation to whatever a company you just create it and 
   blah, blah, blah. Okay. Okay, cool. Yeah, Makes sense. And make sure     
  that with your test companies, you're giving them like a very, and same   
  with the test, like people in deals, like, you know, make sure it says,   
  like, you know, Ish test something just so it's really easy for us to be  
  like, these are fake companies. Yeah, and delete a app there or           
  something. Exactly. So, yeah, I mean, my goal is to get you started on    
  the QA stuff eventually, and eventually it's hopefully not more than like 
   two weeks. Okay. Once you're like, well, one, we have a big need to do   
  the QA stuff now. We see a lot of stuff that needs to be QA. And then the 
   goal is once that's all complete and they have a pretty decent, like,    
  semi-automated QA setup. Yeah. You will probably start working on more of 
   the like AI agentic tasks with Jason. Cool. Cool. But in the short term, 
   it is like of far more importance to us that we get QA's not working. I  
  totally understandable. Yeah, it's very important. So, I mean, you can    
  always, I assume it's pretty easy to re-point it in a direction in the    
  sense that, like, you know, you can start with fraud, right? And then if  
  you repoint the URL to death, it shouldn't be able to go. Yeah. Okay, but 
   you wanted to be able to do both, for sure. Uh, I mean, realistically,   
  it'll probably just need. It's good. I guess run on whatever URL we give  
  it, because it should be pretty much the same regardless.. Most likely    
  it'll run on, yeah, it'll probably run on multi-invironments, so just     
  make sure that it can take a dynamic URL because I can see this being     
  very helpful for like like individual devs, right? As we like write       
  something and we're like, oh, I have this PR. Let me test it in local     
  host to make sure it's working. It will be super helpful if we can be     
  pointing at the local host and it does the same set of testing. Okay.     
  Okay. Yeah, sure. Makes sense. Cool. Out of curiosity, and again, you     
  know, you're new, I'm not holding you to any dates. Do you, like, based   
  on your previous experience, how much time using Claude do you think this 
   will take you to create? Um. You know, I think it could take. I'd        
  probably take one day for prototype just to make, like, see if it can     
  work. I'm not going to say one day, maybe like two days? Give me a little 
   bit. This is more just like ballparks, so I also have an estimate of     
  like when I can start assigning you more tasks. Okay. So, like, you know, 
   I think it will take two days. Yeah. Okay. Cool. Yeah, look at this. It  
  has like a pretty decent end-to-end testing in two days. That would be    
  massive. Okay. And the goal, like, you know, my goal is that this is a    
  pretty accessible tool for anyone on the team. Right. They don't, you     
  know, it doesn't have to have a UI, right? I'm assuming if this is        
  something you run from the CLI, like from Mc Manline, that's fine.        
  There's a couple different ways I'm thinking about it. I think the        
  easiest one for me to build would just be like a skill, hook get up with  
  a couple different things that could probably just be done in a day. And, 
   you know, it wouldn't be like like it would only be accessible to the    
  people who use cloud code, though. That's that, that's. I don't think,    
  but like. Is this a skill thing? Like, Ideally, look, as we scale, like,  
  this should be. Now, it's fine if someone needs to use, like, run, squad  
  to run this, or, you know, because you're using, you know, clod on the    
  back end. Sure. Like what this ideally should be is like an executable    
  that we can point at a URL and then it runs. Okay. Okay, cool. Yeah, that 
   makes sense. Yeah, like. you know, bash script or something. Okay, I can 
   do that. Cool. That makes sense to me. Cool. Um, perfect. All right, as  
  always, reach out with Freel anything you have. Yeah, if I have more      
  questions, I'll definitely reach out to you. Okay. Perfect. All right.    
  Thanks, you. Thank you, Jamie. I appreciate the opportunity, by the way.  
  Really. Yeah, really excited to get started with you guys, man. Hopefully 
   we'll have you on some more interesting things soon, but like. Yeah, but 
   this is definitely a good way to learn the products. Like, um, 100%.     
  This is, I love to do this. Okay, yeah, just poke and prod with a         
  platform. Yeah. All right, sounds good. All right. See you,. See you,     
  Jamie.                                                                    

⏺ I've read through your entire conversation transcript carefully. Let me break
  down what I've extracted and then we'll plan the build.

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  What you're building: A CLI-executable QA agent that uses browser automation
  (Playwright) to test August's web app UI workflows end-to-end, verifiable
  against HubSpot CRM, runnable against any URL (prod/dev/staging/localhost).

  Key constraints from your boss:
  - Must be a bash script / executable (not a Claude Code skill)
  - Must accept a dynamic URL parameter
  - Must be accessible to non-technical team members
  - Functionality QA only (not content quality)
  - 1-2 day timeline for prototype

⏺ No Playwright files found directly. Let me search more specifically for the
  browser-related infrastructure and the money-printer directory.

⏺ Searched for 2 patterns, read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Good findings. There's no existing Playwright/browser automation
  infrastructure in this codebase - this is a greenfield build. The dev-browser
  is a system-level skill, not something in your repo. Let me now move to
  designing the plan.

  Before I finalize, I have a few critical questions:

⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · How does August authenticate users? The QA agent needs to log in to 
     test workflows. → for now we will use my login. but i iwll get them to 
     create a user qa tester account for this agent. what do you think about
      that? and what do you think about the fact that this needs to be n 
     agent 


     · For verifying CRM sync to HubSpot - should the agent navigate 
     HubSpot's web UI, or use HubSpot's API? → Navigate HubSpot UI
     · Where should this project live? → 3 which probably means 2 right? 
     · Do you have a HubSpot API key or private app token available for the 
     QA testing HubSpot instance? → i told you to do navigate to hubspot. 


❯ we can maybe use browseruse library on git? they want it to be able to    
  access localhost, dev, prod, staging, everythign andeverywhere adn use it 
   like a user and note and notice literally all things.                    

⏺ Great answers. I hear you loud and clear. Let me address everything:

  1. Dedicated QA tester account - Excellent idea. The agent should have its own
   account with predictable state. Store creds as env vars so they're not
  hardcoded.
  2. browser-use library - Yes, I know exactly what you mean. browser-use is a
  Python library that uses an LLM + Playwright to control a browser like a
  human. This is far better than raw Playwright for your use case because:
    - It adapts to UI changes (no brittle CSS selectors)
    - It can "see" the page visually and notice bugs a human would
    - It works on any URL - August, HubSpot, localhost, anything
    - It's literally an agent, which is what your boss wants
  3. Standalone project - Got it, standalone location.

  Let me now research browser-use and finalize the plan.

⏺ Updated plan

⏺ ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Why browser-use over raw Playwright: Traditional Playwright tests use
  hardcoded CSS selectors (#login-btn, .conversation-list). When a developer
  changes a class name, tests break. browser-use uses Claude's vision to look at
   the page and decide what to click — just like a human QA tester. This means
  your tests survive UI redesigns, handle unexpected popups, and can visually
  verify things like "are highlights showing colors?" that selector-based tests
  can't.

  Cost tradeoff: Each browser-use step costs ~$0.003-0.01 in LLM tokens. A full
  QA run with ~50-100 steps will cost roughly $0.50-2.00. This is far cheaper
  than a human QA tester's time, and the evidence (screenshots, GIFs, structured
   JSON reports) is richer than manual testing notes.

  The "agent" distinction: Your boss specifically said "agent" not "test suite."
   browser-use makes this a true agent — it reasons about what it sees, decides
  what to do next, handles errors gracefully, and reports findings in natural
  language. It's the difference between a script that clicks buttons and an AI
  that uses your product.
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Here's what the plan covers:

  - Bash executable (august-qa.sh) — point at any URL, run all or specific
  workflows
  - browser-use + Claude Sonnet — LLM-driven browser agent that acts like a real
   user
  - 6 workflows matching your boss's walkthrough: Login, Conversations, CRM
  Entities (companies/contacts/deals), Overview/Coaching, Todos, HubSpot
  Verification
  - Evidence collection — screenshots, GIF recordings, JSON + HTML reports
  - Test data naming — QA-Test-Co-2026-02-09-{random} so fake data is obvious
  - Dynamic URL — works on prod, dev, staging, localhost
  - Standalone project at august-qa/

  Regarding "this is a new code" — yes, this is entirely new, greenfield code.
  No existing infrastructure to build on.

     - Click into a conversation → verify loads without errors  - Test "Retag 
    Speakers" (rename a speaker, verify cloud function fires)  - Verify 
    highlights show colors (known bug: they don't)  - Check transcript, 
    insights, coaching tab (click deep dive)  Flow 2 — Entity Creation  - Create
     test company (e.g., "Ishan Test Co 2026-02-09")  - Create test contact  - 
    Create test deal  - All with obvious test naming ("Ish test...")  - Verify 
    entities appear in August's UI  Flow 3 — CRM Sync (HubSpot)  - From a 
    conversation, sync to CRM  - Verify action items + conversation summaries 
    sync  - Navigate to HubSpot and confirm data actually landed  - Link 
    conversation to created test entities  Flow 4 — Overview Tab  - Verify 
    overview displays  - Select a specific rep → check feedback metrics  - Test 
    AI takeaways (they rejig based on selection)  - Generate a coaching report 
    for a rep  - Check objections page  Flow 5 — Todos  - Mark something as

    said do this manually  ---  Architecture Decision  Based on research, the 
    winning approach is:  Python + Playwright (async) + Anthropic Vision API, 
    wrapped in bash  Why this stack:  - Playwright gives full programmatic 
    browser control (click, type, navigate, screenshot)  - Claude Vision API 
    gives intelligent verification — you send a screenshot and ask "does this 
    look right? are there errors?" instead of brittle CSS  selectors  - Bash 
    wrapper makes it a one-command executable anyone can run  - Self-healing: 
    when selectors break (and they will in an early-stage app), Claude can 
    analyze the page and figure out where things are  How It Works  $ 
    ./august-qa https://app.august.so    → Launches headless Chromium via 
    Playwright    → Logs in with configured credentials    → Executes each test 
    flow sequentially    → At each step: takes screenshot → sends to Claude 
    Vision → gets pass/fail + bug descriptions    → Opens HubSpot in second tab 
    for sync verification    → Generates a report with screenshots + findings

    Insight ─────────────────────────────────────  Why Vision API over pure 
    selectors? Early-stage apps change their UI constantly. Selector-based tests
     (#btn-sync, .conversation-card) break every time  someone renames a CSS 
    class. Vision-based verification ("I see a list of conversations with names 
    and dates") survives UI changes as long as the feature  still exists. It's 
    the difference between testing implementation vs testing intent.  Why not 
    Claude Computer Use? Computer Use is designed for desktop control 
    (mouse/keyboard at the OS level). Playwright gives you direct DOM access —  
    faster, more reliable, and you can run it headless in CI/CD. You get the 
    best of both worlds by combining Playwright's precision with Claude Vision's
      intelligence.  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────  ---

⏺ I see — you want me to absorb the other agent's analysis and compare it with
  mine before moving forward. Let me do that carefully.

⏺ Entered plan mode
  Claude is now exploring and designing an implementation approach.

⏺ Good. Let me lay out the comparison between both approaches and then converge
  on the best path.

  Comparison: My Plan vs. Other Agent's Plan
  Dimension: Browser control
  My Plan (browser-use): browser-use handles LLM↔Playwright loop automatically
  Other Agent (Playwright + Vision API): Raw Playwright — you code the
    clicks/navigation explicitly
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Dimension: Verification
  My Plan (browser-use): LLM decides + verifies everything (navigation AND
    assertions)
  Other Agent (Playwright + Vision API): Playwright navigates, Claude Vision
    verifies screenshots
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Dimension: Determinism
  My Plan (browser-use): Non-deterministic (~83% accuracy). Agent may take
    different paths each run
  Other Agent (Playwright + Vision API): Deterministic navigation, intelligent
    verification
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Dimension: Resilience to UI changes
  My Plan (browser-use): Very high — adapts to any layout
  Other Agent (Playwright + Vision API): Medium — selectors may break but Vision

    catches visual bugs
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Dimension: Debugging
  My Plan (browser-use): Harder — "why did the agent click there?"
  Other Agent (Playwright + Vision API): Easier — you know exactly what step
    failed
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Dimension: Code volume
  My Plan (browser-use): Less code (natural language tasks)
  Other Agent (Playwright + Vision API): More code (explicit Playwright calls
  per
     step)
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Dimension: Speed
  My Plan (browser-use): Slower (LLM call per action, ~62s per task)
  Other Agent (Playwright + Vision API): Faster (Playwright is instant, Vision
    only at checkpoints)
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Dimension: Cost
  My Plan (browser-use): Higher ($0.50-2.00 — LLM call per browser action)
  Other Agent (Playwright + Vision API): Lower ($0.10-0.50 — LLM only at
    verification points)
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Dimension: Dependencies
  My Plan (browser-use): browser-use, playwright, anthropic
  Other Agent (Playwright + Vision API): playwright, anthropic (fewer deps)
  Both plans agree on:
  - Bash entry point, dynamic URL, standalone project
  - 6 identical test flows (from Jamie's walkthrough)
  - Screenshot evidence + reporting
  - Test data naming convention (QA-Test-Co-*)
  - Navigate HubSpot UI (not API) for verification
  - Python + Playwright + Claude as the stack

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  The critical architectural decision: browser-use gives you a fully autonomous 
  agent where the LLM decides every click. Playwright + Vision gives you a
  guided agent where you script the navigation and the LLM only judges results.
  For QA specifically, the hybrid (Playwright + Vision) is arguably better
  because:
  1. QA needs reproducibility — you want the same test to check the same things
  every time
  2. QA needs speed — running after every deploy means it can't take 10 minutes
  3. QA needs debuggability — when it reports a bug, you need to know exactly
  what step revealed it

  But browser-use gives you the "agent" feel your boss wants and adapts better
  to an early-stage product where the UI changes constantly.
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Which architecture approach do you want for the QA agent? → you 
     decide. in my head brwoseruse is better if we have the process down in 
     the prompts. it needs full context of august and how august looks and 
     what its supposedto look like nad etc. 

     · Do you know the CSS framework or component library August's web app 
     uses? (Helps with selector strategy if we go hybrid) → Don't know / 
     doesn't matter

⏺ Great decision-making instinct. You're right — browser-use with deeply 
  contextual prompts is the play. The quality of the QA agent is 100% determined
   by how well the prompts describe what August should look like. The agent
  needs to know what "correct" means to spot what's wrong.

  Let me finalize the plan with this architecture and the critical addition of
  an August context file that teaches the agent what the product is supposed to
  be.

⏺ Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Good, I've re-read the full plan. Now let me update it with the critical
  insight from both analyses — the August context file approach and the refined
  architecture.

⏺ Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview

⏺ ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  The AUGUST_CONTEXT.md approach is the differentiator. Both plans use browser
  automation + LLM, but the quality difference comes from context. A browser-use
   agent with a vague prompt ("test the conversations page") will fumble. An
  agent with detailed product knowledge ("Conversations has My/Team subtabs,
  detail view should have audio player, retag speakers button, highlights with
  colors...") will catch real bugs because it knows what "correct" means.

  This is essentially prompt engineering as QA specification. Instead of writing
   test assertions in code (expect(selector).toBeVisible()), you write them in
  English ("if highlights exist but have no colors, report as BUG"). This means
  non-technical team members can add new test criteria by editing a markdown
  file.

  The tradeoff you're accepting: ~$1-2 per run and ~3-5 minutes vs. $0 and 30
  seconds with raw Playwright. But you gain: zero selector maintenance, visual
  verification, and an agent that works even when the UI changes.
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  The plan is ready. It synthesizes both your meeting transcript with Jamie and
  the other agent's analysis. Key differences from the other approach:
  - Uses browser-use (true agent behavior) instead of Playwright + Vision API
  (scripted + checked)
  - Adds AUGUST_CONTEXT.md — the agent's product knowledge base
  - Prompt engineering is the primary specification mechanism, not code
  ⎿ Tool use rejected with user message: I gave the pair agent the same plan or 
    what you said, and this is what it said:⏺ Excellent — this is a really

    ────────┘  The Synthesis — Best of Both  The other agent's AUGUST_CONTEXT.md
     approach is the key insight I was missing. This is brilliant because:  1. 
    It makes the prompts richer without making the code more complex  2. 
    Non-technical team members can update it when the UI changes  3. It's the 
    "product spec" that teaches the agent what "correct" looks like  Let me 
    merge both plans into the final version.
























⏺ I've read the other agent's synthesis. It validates that my plan had the
  critical differentiators — AUGUST_CONTEXT.md, .env for secrets, systematic
  prompt strategy, and the risk table. But the other agent brings valuable
  additions: more granular per-step detail in the flows and verified API
  constructor signatures.

  Let me merge the best of both into the final plan.

⏺ Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Good — the other agent validated my plan and identified that the key things I
  got right were:
  1. AUGUST_CONTEXT.md (the other agent didn't have this)
  2. .env for secrets (not plaintext in YAML)
  3. Systematic prompt strategy (context + instructions + criteria)
  4. Risk table
  5. Separate HubSpot verification workflow

  The things the other agent does better (more granular per-step detail and
  verified constructor signatures) are implementation details I'll handle during
   the build.

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  What the two-agent comparison revealed: Both agents converged on the same core
   stack (browser-use + Claude + Playwright), same workflows, and same project
  structure. The divergence was in how deeply the prompts are engineered — which
   is the entire value proposition. The AUGUST_CONTEXT.md approach transforms
  this from "test suite with LLM" into "agent with product knowledge." This is
  the pattern that makes browser-use work reliably despite its 83% baseline
  accuracy.

  The meta-lesson: When building LLM-powered tools, the code is often the easy
  part. The quality lives in the prompts, context, and domain knowledge you feed
   the model. This is why the plan emphasizes the context file and prompt
  strategy over code architecture.
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  The plan is finalized and synthesized. Both agents agree on the approach.
  Ready to build when you are.

       ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────                          
                                                                                
           The "prompt as spec" pattern: Traditional QA writes test assertions 
    in code (expect(element).toBeVisible()). This agent writes assertions in 
    English ("if   highlights exist but have no colors, report as BUG"). This 
    means: (1) non-technical team members can add test criteria by editing 
    AUGUST_CONTEXT.md, (2)  the agent catches categories of bugs, not just 
    specific ones, and (3) when August redesigns a page, you update a markdown 
    file instead of rewriting test  code.  The cost tradeoff: ~$1-2 per run, 3-5
     minutes. A human QA tester costs $30-50/hour and takes 20+ minutes for the 
    same coverage. The evidence (screenshots,   GIFs, structured reports) is 
    richer than manual testing notes. This math works well for post-deploy 
    verification.  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Implementation Plan                                                         
        Synthesized from two independent agent analyses Context August is an 
    early-stage sales intelligence platform ("Gong for outside sales") with 6 
    platforms (Web, iOS, Android, Desktop PC/Mac, Apple Watch). Team is  
    migrating Firebase → Postgres on Neon, causing cascading sync issues. 
    Frequent deploys + early stage = lots of UI bugs. Jamie wants a QA agent 
    that any team member can point at any URL (prod, dev, staging, localhost) 
    and have it test August's web app like a real user. Deliverable: 
    Bash-executable QA agent. Not a test suite — an agent that navigates, 
    clicks, creates data, verifies CRM sync, and reports bugs with 
    screenshot/GIF evidence. Architecture: browser-use + Claude +

⏺ I've read the other agent's final plan carefully. Here's my honest comparison:

  Where the Plans Match (95% converged)

  Both plans are now essentially identical on: architecture, project structure,
  file list, workflows, prompt strategy, AUGUST_CONTEXT.md (which originated
  from my plan and the other agent adopted it), .env for secrets, config.yaml,
  terminal output format, risks table, and verification plan.

  Where the Other Agent's Plan is Better
  Detail: browser-use API
  My Plan: Generic Agent(task, llm, browser)
  Other Agent: Specific: BrowserSession, BrowserProfile, use_vision=True,
    sensitive_data, max_actions_per_step=5, use_thinking=True
  Winner: Other agent — more implementation-ready
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Detail: sensitive_data param
  My Plan: Not mentioned
  Other Agent: Masks passwords in logs
  Winner: Other agent — security win
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Detail: Flag naming
  My Plan: --headless false
  Other Agent: --headed (opt-in)
  Winner: Other agent — cleaner UX
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Detail: Exit codes
  My Plan: Not mentioned
  Other Agent: $? → 0/1 for CI/CD
  Winner: Other agent — important for automation
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Detail: Time estimate
  My Plan: ~2 hours
  Other Agent: ~3.5 hours
  Winner: Other agent — more realistic
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Detail: LLM import
  My Plan: from browser_use.llm import ChatAnthropic
  Other Agent: from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
  Winner: Mine — my research found langchain's has ainvoke() compatibility
  issues
     with browser-use
  Where My Plan is Better
  Detail: Prompt strategy formula
  My Plan: Explicit 4-layer: CONTEXT + INSTRUCTIONS + CRITERIA + TEST_DATA
  Other Agent: Described but less structured
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Detail: Example prompt
  My Plan: Full 20-line conversations prompt shown
  Other Agent: Not shown
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Detail: LLM wrapper choice
  My Plan: browser_use.llm.ChatAnthropic (tested against browser-use's
  ainvoke())
  Other Agent: langchain_anthropic.ChatAnthropic (known compatibility issues per

    GitHub #2134)
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Detail: Known bugs in context
  My Plan: Included in AUGUST_CONTEXT.md
  Other Agent: Referenced but not as explicit
  Synthesis

  The two plans are now 95% the same. The other agent brought better API
  specifics (sensitive_data, use_thinking, exact constructor params). I brought
  the prompt engineering depth and the LLM import fix. The merged plan should
  use:

  - My browser_use.llm.ChatAnthropic import (avoids langchain compatibility
  issues)
  - Other agent's sensitive_data, use_thinking=True, max_actions_per_step=5
  - Other agent's --headed flag naming
  - Other agent's exit code behavior
  - My 4-layer prompt formula with example
  - Both: everything else (identical)

  Let me update my plan with these final merges.

⏺ Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview

⏺ ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Why the LLM import matters: browser-use calls ainvoke() internally on whatever
   LLM you pass it. LangChain's ChatAnthropic has known issues where ainvoke()
  returns unexpected formats. browser-use's own wrapper (from browser_use.llm 
  import ChatAnthropic) is tested against their internal calling patterns. This
  is the kind of bug that would cost you 2 hours of debugging with a cryptic
  TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable deep in the agent loop.

  The sensitive_data param is a hidden gem: Instead of the agent seeing your
  actual password in its context (which it then might echo in error logs or GIF
  recordings), you pass sensitive_data={"x_password": "actual_pass"} and in the
  prompt write "enter x_password". browser-use replaces the placeholder at
  execution time. This means GIF recordings and logs never contain real
  credentials.
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  The plan is now the definitive synthesis of both agents' work. The two key
  merges:
  1. From other agent: sensitive_data, use_thinking, max_actions_per_step,
  --headed flag, exit codes, realistic time estimate
  2. From my plan: browser_use.llm.ChatAnthropic import (avoid langchain
  issues), 4-layer prompt formula, full example prompt, AUGUST_CONTEXT.md with
  known bugs
  ⎿ Tool use rejected with user message: i dont know. what are we making adn 
    why. what is the plan. approach this as a systems engineer/ qa engineer/ 
    agent engineer.

⏺ Fair push-back. Let me start from scratch and be crystal clear.

  ---
  What We're Building

  A command-line QA automation tool for August's web app.

  You type:
  ./august-qa.sh --url https://app.august.com --headed

  An AI-powered browser opens, logs into August, clicks through every page,
  creates test data, syncs to HubSpot, navigates to HubSpot to verify the sync
  worked, and then prints a report telling you what's broken. With screenshots
  and GIF recordings as proof.

  ---
  Why

  August has 6 platforms and ships fast. Every deploy, someone on the team has
  to manually click through the app to make sure nothing broke. That doesn't
  scale. Jamie wants to replace that manual process with an agent that:

  1. Any team member can run — just a bash command, no dev tools needed
  2. Works on any URL — prod, dev, staging, localhost (the same tool for
  everyone)
  3. Acts like a real user — doesn't use internal APIs or selectors, actually
  clicks buttons
  4. Reports bugs with evidence — screenshots, GIFs, structured JSON

  ---
  The Three Engineering Perspectives

  As a Systems Engineer

  The system is simple:

  Input:  URL + Credentials
  Process: AI browser agent runs 6 test workflows
  Output:  Bug report (JSON/HTML) + screenshots + GIFs + exit code (0=pass,
  1=fail)

  Components:
  - Bash wrapper (august-qa.sh) — entry point, checks Python, manages venv
  - Python orchestrator (src/main.py) — parses args, runs workflows
  sequentially, generates report
  - browser-use library — open-source Python package that wraps Playwright
  (browser automation) + Claude (AI). You give it a natural language task, it
  opens a browser, screenshots the page, asks Claude what to click, clicks it,
  repeats until done.
  - 6 workflow modules — each one knows how to test one section of August's app
  - AUGUST_CONTEXT.md — a markdown file that describes what August should look
  like. This is the agent's "product specification."

  Data flow:
  .env (credentials) + config.yaml (settings) + AUGUST_CONTEXT.md (product
  knowledge)
      ↓
  main.py loads all three, creates a browser session
      ↓
  For each workflow (login → conversations → entities → overview → todos →
  hubspot):
      workflow builds a prompt = AUGUST_CONTEXT + step-by-step instructions +
  bug criteria
      browser-use agent executes the prompt (screenshots page → Claude decides
  action → Playwright executes)
      results collected (pass/fail, bugs found, screenshots, GIF)
      ↓
  reporter.py generates JSON + HTML report
      ↓
  Exit code 0 (all pass) or 1 (failures found)

  As a QA Engineer

  The 6 workflows test everything Jamie walked through in the meeting:
  #: 1
  Workflow: Login
  What It Tests: Can you log in? Does dashboard load?
  Bug Criteria: Login error, blank page, infinite loading
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  #: 2
  Workflow: Conversations
  What It Tests: List loads, detail view works, retag speakers, highlights have
    colors, coaching, action items
  Bug Criteria: Empty list, retag error, colorless highlights, broken coaching,
    action items don't update
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  #: 3
  Workflow: CRM Entities
  What It Tests: Create company/contact/deal, link to conversation
  Bug Criteria: Create fails, doesn't appear in list, link doesn't save
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  #: 4
  Workflow: Overview
  What It Tests: Metrics display, rep selector works, coaching reports generate
  Bug Criteria: Blank metrics, generate fails, objections empty
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  #: 5
  Workflow: Todos
  What It Tests: Mark important → appears in Todos, mark done → updates
  Bug Criteria: Doesn't appear, doesn't update
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  #: 6
  Workflow: HubSpot Verify
  What It Tests: Synced data actually shows up in HubSpot
  Bug Criteria: Entity missing, summary missing, meeting missing
  Test data naming convention: QA-Test-Co-2026-02-09-a7f3 — obviously fake, easy
   to clean up.

  What we DON'T test: CRM connect/disconnect (manual per Jamie), content quality
   of AI outputs, mobile/desktop apps (web-only MVP).

  As an Agent Engineer

  This is where it gets interesting. We're not writing a traditional test suite
  with selectors. We're building an AI agent that:

  1. Sees the page — browser-use takes a screenshot and sends it to Claude with
  vision
  2. Understands what to do — the prompt says "click on Conversations tab, you
  should see a list..."
  3. Decides what to click — Claude analyzes the screenshot and picks the right
  element
  4. Knows what "correct" looks like — because AUGUST_CONTEXT.md describes the
  expected UI
  5. Reports anomalies — anything that doesn't match expectations is flagged as
  a bug

  The prompt is the specification. Each workflow prompt has 4 layers:

  Layer 1: AUGUST_CONTEXT.md     → "This is a sales intelligence platform, the
  conversations page has..."
  Layer 2: Workflow instructions  → "Step 1: Click Conversations. Step 2: Click
  Team tab..."
  Layer 3: Bug criteria           → "Report as BUG if highlights have no
  colors..."
  Layer 4: Test data conventions  → "Name test entities
  QA-Test-{type}-{date}-{rand}"

  Why browser-use over raw Playwright?
  - Playwright: await page.click('#conversations-tab') — breaks when ID changes
  - browser-use: "Click on the Conversations tab" — works regardless of what the
   DOM looks like

  The tradeoff: browser-use is ~83% accurate, costs ~$1-2/run, and takes 3-5
  minutes. Raw Playwright is 100% deterministic, $0, and 30 seconds. But
  Playwright breaks every time someone changes a CSS class in an early-stage
  app. browser-use adapts.

  Does this make sense now? Any part of the system, QA, or agent design you want
   me to go deeper on before we start building?

⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Is this clear enough to start building? Or do you want me to go 
     deeper on any specific aspect? → More on QA workflows

⏺ Let me break down every workflow in full detail — exactly what the agent does,
   what it looks for, and what counts as a bug.

  ---
  Workflow 1: Login

  Purpose: Prerequisite for everything else. If login fails, all other workflows
   skip.

  Step-by-step:
  1. Navigate to {url}
  2. Wait for login page to load
  3. Find email input field → type AUGUST_EMAIL
  4. Find password input field → type AUGUST_PASSWORD (masked via
  sensitive_data)
  5. Click the login/sign-in button
  6. Wait for redirect to dashboard/main page

  Pass criteria:
  - Dashboard loads with navigation visible (Conversations, Companies, etc.)
  - No error toasts/modals

  Bug criteria:
  - Login button doesn't respond
  - Error message appears ("Invalid credentials", "Something went wrong", etc.)
  - Page hangs on loading spinner > 15 seconds
  - Redirects to unexpected page
  - Console errors visible on screen

  Edge cases the agent handles:
  - If there's a "Welcome back" modal or onboarding flow, dismiss it
  - If there's a cookie consent banner, accept it
  - If 2FA is required, report as SKIP (can't automate 2FA without TOTP)

  Output: {login_success: true/false, page_after_login: "dashboard", errors: 
  null}

  ---
  Workflow 2: Conversations (Most Critical)

  Purpose: This is August's core product. Jamie spent the most time on this
  during the walkthrough.

  Step-by-step:
  PHASE A — List View
  1. Click "Conversations" in navigation
  2. VERIFY: A list of conversations appears with:
     - Participant names (e.g., "Jason K", "Ishan S")
     - Dates/timestamps
     - Duration or status indicators
     → BUG if: list is empty, shows error, takes >10s to load

  3. Click "My" sub-tab (or verify it's already selected)
  4. VERIFY: Shows conversations the logged-in user participated in
     → BUG if: "My" tab shows nothing when team tab has data

  5. Click "Team" sub-tab
  6. VERIFY: Shows all team members' conversations
     - Team member names should be visible
     → BUG if: team tab is empty, team members not listed

  PHASE B — Detail View
  7. Click the most recent conversation to open it
  8. VERIFY the detail view loads with these sections:
     a. Audio player — should be visible, with play controls
     b. Participant names listed
     c. Transcript section — should show text content
     d. Coaching section — should have content or tabs
     → BUG if: any section missing, error displayed, blank content

  PHASE C — Feature Tests
  9. Find "Retag Speakers" button → click it
  10. A modal/dialog should appear with speaker names
  11. Try to rename one speaker to "QA-Test-Speaker-{random}"
  12. Submit the rename
     → BUG if: "Cloud function upgrade" error (KNOWN BUG)
     → BUG if: modal doesn't open
     → BUG if: collision with audio player (KNOWN BUG)
     → BUG if: rename doesn't save

  13. Look at the Highlights section
  14. VERIFY: Highlights have colored markers/badges
     → BUG if: highlights exist but are all gray/no color (KNOWN BUG)
     → SKIP if: no highlights exist for this conversation

  15. Click "Coaching" tab
  16. VERIFY: coaching feedback sections appear
  17. Click "Deep Dive" on any coaching section
  18. VERIFY: expanded/detailed content loads
     → BUG if: deep dive content is empty or errors

  PHASE D — Action Items
  19. Find an action item with a checkbox
  20. Click the checkbox to mark it as done
  21. VERIFY: checkbox state updates (visual confirmation)
     → BUG if: checkbox doesn't toggle
     → BUG if: error toast appears

  Why this is 21 steps: Conversations is August's core feature. Every
  sub-feature (retag, highlights, coaching, action items) was explicitly called
  out by Jamie. The agent needs to be thorough here.

  ---
  Workflow 3: CRM Entities

  Purpose: Test CRUD operations + conversation linking + CRM sync trigger.

  Step-by-step:
  PHASE A — Create Company
  1. Navigate to "Companies" tab
  2. VERIFY: Companies list loads (may be empty or have existing companies)
  3. Find "Create" / "Add" / "+" button → click it
  4. Fill the form:
     - Name: "QA-Test-Co-{date}-{random4}" (e.g., "QA-Test-Co-2026-02-09-a7f3")
     - Domain: "qatest-{random4}.example.com"
  5. Submit the form
  6. VERIFY: New company appears in the companies list
     - Look for the exact name you just entered
     → BUG if: company doesn't appear, error on submit, form validation fails

  PHASE B — Create Contact
  7. Navigate to "Contacts" tab
  8. Click create button
  9. Fill: Name = "QA-Test-Contact-{date}-{random4}"
  10. Submit
  11. VERIFY: Contact appears in list
     → BUG if: same as company

  PHASE C — Create Deal
  12. Navigate to "Deals" tab
  13. Click create button
  14. Fill: Name = "QA-Test-Deal-{date}-{random4}"
  15. Submit
  16. VERIFY: Deal appears in list
     → BUG if: same as above

  PHASE D — Link + Sync
  17. Go back to Conversations → open the most recent conversation
  18. Find the option to link/associate this conversation with a company
  19. Link it to the test company created in step 4-5
  20. VERIFY: Link shows (company name appears on conversation)
     → BUG if: link doesn't save, company not found in search

  21. Find "Sync to CRM" button → click it
  22. VERIFY: Sync initiates without error
     - May show "Syncing..." or progress indicator
     - May show success toast
     → BUG if: sync button errors, shows failure message

  23. Check badges on the company in Companies list
  24. VERIFY: Badges/indicators show correctly
     → BUG if: badges missing or misaligned

  Test data strategy: Every entity is prefixed with QA-Test- so they're
  immediately recognizable as test data. The date + random suffix prevents
  collisions across runs.

  ---
  Workflow 4: Overview & Coaching

  Purpose: Test the team analytics dashboard and AI-generated coaching.

  Step-by-step:
  1. Navigate to "Overview" tab
  2. VERIFY: Overview page displays with:
     - Some form of metrics/charts
     - Team performance data
     → BUG if: page is blank, error displayed

  3. VERIFY: Badges show up correctly (Jamie emphasized this)
     → BUG if: badges missing or broken

  4. Find the rep selector dropdown
  5. Select a specific rep (any team member)
  6. VERIFY: Page "rejigs" — metrics update to show that rep's data
     - Charts/numbers should change
     → BUG if: page doesn't update, shows stale data, errors

  7. Find "AI Takeaways" section
  8. VERIFY: Takeaways display (or a "Generate" button is available)
     → BUG if: section entirely missing

  9. Click "Generate" to create a coaching report
  10. Wait for generation (may take several seconds)
  11. VERIFY: Coaching report content appears
     - Should show coaching advice, metrics, recommendations
     → BUG if: generation hangs, produces error, returns empty

  12. Navigate to "Objections" tab/section
  13. VERIFY: Objections data displays
     - Should show common objections and how the team handles them
     → BUG if: empty, error, missing content

  ---
  Workflow 5: Todos

  Purpose: Test the action item → Todo pipeline.

  Step-by-step:
  1. Go to Conversations → open a conversation
  2. Find an action item
  3. Mark it as "important" (star, flag, or similar)
  4. VERIFY: Importance indicator appears on the item
     → BUG if: no visual feedback when marking important

  5. Navigate to "Todos" tab in main navigation
  6. VERIFY: The item you just marked as important appears in the Todos list
     → BUG if: item doesn't appear (pipeline broken)

  7. Check due date display
     - Items may show "no due date" — this is VALID, not a bug
     → BUG if: due date shows as undefined/null/NaN

  8. Click to mark a todo as "done"
  9. VERIFY: Todo shows as completed (strikethrough, checkmark, moved to
  completed section)
     → BUG if: doesn't update, error on click

  ---
  Workflow 6: HubSpot Verification

  Purpose: The most complex — cross-application verification. Tests that data
  actually synced from August to HubSpot.

  Step-by-step:
  PHASE A — Navigate to HubSpot
  1. Open a new browser tab (browser-use supports multi-tab)
  2. Navigate to HubSpot URL (from config)
  3. Log in with HubSpot credentials
     → SKIP entire workflow if: 2FA required, CAPTCHA, login fails
  4. VERIFY: HubSpot dashboard loads

  PHASE B — Verify Company Sync
  5. Use HubSpot's search or navigate to Companies
  6. Search for the test company name from Workflow 3 (e.g.,
  "QA-Test-Co-2026-02-09-a7f3")
  7. VERIFY: Company exists in HubSpot
     → BUG if: company not found (sync failed)

  PHASE C — Verify Contact Sync
  8. Search for the test contact
  9. VERIFY: Contact exists
     → BUG if: not found

  PHASE D — Verify Conversation Data
  10. Open the synced company/contact record
  11. Look for synced conversation data:
      - Action items from the conversation
      - Conversation summary
  12. VERIFY: Data is present on the HubSpot record
      → BUG if: no conversation data, partial sync

  PHASE E — Verify Meeting
  13. Navigate to HubSpot Meetings section
  14. Search for or find the meeting record from the synced conversation
  15. VERIFY: Meeting exists with correct details
      → BUG if: meeting not found

  PHASE F — Cleanup
  16. Close HubSpot tab
  17. Return to August tab

  This is the riskiest workflow because:
  - HubSpot may have 2FA or CAPTCHA
  - Sync is async — there may be a delay between August syncing and HubSpot
  receiving
  - HubSpot's UI is complex and changes frequently
  - May need to wait 10-30 seconds for sync to propagate

  Mitigation: If HubSpot login fails, the entire workflow reports SKIP (not
  FAIL). We don't want CI/CD to fail because HubSpot asked for 2FA.

  If login fails → everything else skips.
  If crm_entities fails → hubspot_verify still runs but may not find test data
  (reports what it finds).

  Does this level of detail make the QA coverage clear? Want me to go deeper on
  any specific workflow, or are we ready to build?

⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Are the 6 workflows clear? Anything to add, remove, or change before 
     we build? → i juST ASKED YOU SOMETING AND YOU COPLETELY IGNORED ME?


❯ how is each workflow going to be pointed toward. what about if theres new 
   features or workflows that users will use. and finall , how is all of my 
   team going to use this agent?                                            

⏺ I apologize for missing your questions. Let me answer all three directly.

  ---
  1. How is each workflow pointed toward the app?

  Every workflow starts from the same base URL you provide on the command line.
  The agent navigates from there.

  ./august-qa.sh --url https://app.august.com

  The agent doesn't hardcode paths like /conversations or /companies. Instead,
  it clicks through the navigation like a user would. Here's the flow:

  Login workflow:   Navigates to {url} → finds login form → logs in → lands on
  dashboard
  Conversations:    From dashboard → clicks "Conversations" in the nav → tests
  everything there
  CRM Entities:     From wherever it is → clicks "Companies" in nav → creates
  company → clicks "Contacts" → etc.
  Overview:         Clicks "Overview" in nav → tests
  Todos:            Clicks "Todos" in nav → tests
  HubSpot:          Opens NEW TAB → navigates to HubSpot URL (separate param) →
  logs in → verifies

  This is the whole point of using browser-use instead of Playwright. The agent
  doesn't need to know that Companies lives at /dashboard/companies. It just
  clicks the "Companies" tab in the navigation because that's what a user would
  do. If August renames the URL or restructures routing, the agent still works
  because it navigates visually.

  The HubSpot URL is a separate parameter because it's a different app:
  ./august-qa.sh --url https://app.august.com --hubspot-url
  https://app.hubspot.com

  ---
  2. What about new features or workflows?

  This is designed to be extensible. Adding a new workflow is a 3-step process:

  Step 1: Create a new workflow file

  Copy any existing workflow (e.g., todos.py) and modify the prompt:

  # src/workflows/smartwatch_sync.py

  class SmartWatchSyncWorkflow(BaseWorkflow):
      name = "smartwatch_sync"

      def build_prompt(self) -> str:
          return f"""
          {self.august_context}
          
          YOUR TASK — Test Smartwatch Sync:
          1. Navigate to Settings → Integrations
          2. Find Apple Watch sync option
          3. VERIFY: sync status shows "Connected"
          ...
          """

  Step 2: Register it

  Add one line to config.yaml:
  workflows:
    - login
    - conversations
    - crm_entities
    - overview
    - todos
    - hubspot_verify
    - smartwatch_sync    # ← new

  Step 3: Update AUGUST_CONTEXT.md (if needed)

  Add a section describing what the new feature should look like:
  ## Smartwatch Sync
  - Settings → Integrations shows Apple Watch connection status
  - Status should be "Connected" or "Not Connected"
  - Sync button triggers data push to watch

  That's it. No code changes to main.py, agent.py, or any other infrastructure.
  The workflow registry automatically picks up new files listed in the config.

  Anyone on the team can add a new workflow by writing a markdown-style prompt
  in a Python file. You don't need to know Playwright, CSS selectors, or browser
   automation. You just describe what to test in English.

  3. How will your team use this agent?

  Here's the realistic usage model for different team members:

  For Developers (after a PR / before deploy)

  # Clone the repo (one-time)
  git clone <august-qa-repo>
  cd august-qa
  ./setup.sh  # installs everything

  # After making changes, test on localhost
  ./august-qa.sh --url http://localhost:3000 --headed

  # Test on dev before merging
  ./august-qa.sh --url https://dev.august.com

  For Jamie / Non-Technical Team (QA after deploy)

  # After a prod deploy
  cd august-qa
  ./august-qa.sh --url https://app.august.com --headed

  # Open the report
  open reports/qa-report-*.html  # opens in browser with screenshots

  For CI/CD (Automated — Future Enhancement)

  # In GitHub Actions or similar:
  - name: Run QA
    run: |
      cd august-qa
      ./august-qa.sh --url https://staging.august.com
      # Exit code 1 = block the deploy

  What team members need:
  Prerequisite: Python 3.11+
  One-time?: Yes
  How: Already on most Macs. brew install python@3.11
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Prerequisite: The repo
  One-time?: Yes
  How: git clone <url>
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Prerequisite: Setup
  One-time?: Yes
  How: ./setup.sh (installs browser-use + Chromium)
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Prerequisite: .env file
  One-time?: Yes
  How: Copy .env.example, fill in credentials
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Prerequisite: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
  One-time?: Yes
  How: One shared key, or per-person keys
  After setup, it's literally one command. No IDE, no dev tools, no Docker.
  Just:
  ./august-qa.sh --url <whatever-url>

  The Report Everyone Sees

  The HTML report is the deliverable. It opens in any browser and shows:
  - Per-workflow pass/fail with timestamps
  - Every bug found with a screenshot showing what went wrong
  - GIF recordings of the agent clicking through each workflow
  - Total cost of the run
  - Summary: "5/6 passed, 2 bugs found"

  This is what you share in Slack after a deploy: "QA run complete — 2 bugs
  found" + link to report.

  Does this answer your three questions? Ready to build, or more to discuss?

⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Does this address your questions about workflow targeting, 
     extensibility, and team usage? → this is too much friction. they need 
     to be able to put in a prompt like "test the full ux" or "just created 
     a new feature, test it out" or i want to check the bugs on august or 
     anythign like that. for now it needs to be august web app.. i dont want
      to make them copy env keys and shit like that. 


⏺ You're absolutely right — I was over-engineering the UX. Let me rethink this
  completely.

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  The friction problem: I was designing a developer tool (flags, .env files,
  manual config). Your boss wants a product — something anyone on the team can
  use with zero setup friction. The difference: a developer tool requires
  documentation. A product requires onboarding UX.

  The natural language insight: Instead of --workflow conversations, the user
  types "test conversations". Instead of choosing workflows, they describe what
  they want. This means we need a router — a small Claude call that interprets
  the prompt and decides what to test.
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Revised UX

  # Full QA (no args = test everything)
  ./august-qa

  # Natural language focus
  ./august-qa "test the full ux"
  ./august-qa "just deployed the coaching feature, test it"
  ./august-qa "check if retag speakers is broken"
  ./august-qa "I think there's a bug on the conversations page"

  # Different environments (shortcuts, not URLs)
  ./august-qa --dev "test conversations"
  ./august-qa --staging
  ./august-qa --local

  Zero-Friction Setup

  One-time interactive setup (the first time anyone runs it):

  $ ./august-qa
  First time setup! Let's get you configured.

  August environment URLs:
    Prod URL [https://app.august.com]: (enter to accept default)
    Dev URL [https://dev.august.com]: 
    
  Credentials (for QA tester account):
    August email: qa-tester@august.so
    August password: ********
    Anthropic API key: sk-ant-...
    HubSpot email (optional): 
    HubSpot password (optional): 

  Config saved to ~/.august-qa/config
  Ready! Run: ./august-qa "test everything"

  After that first run, credentials are stored at ~/.august-qa/config (in the
  user's home directory, not in the repo). No .env file, no copying keys, no git
   risk.

  Even better: You could set up ONE shared QA account and pre-configure a single
   ~/.august-qa/config file that gets distributed (via Slack, 1Password,
  whatever). Then team members just:
  # One-time
  git clone <repo> && cd august-qa && ./setup.sh

  # Every time after
  ./august-qa "test everything"

  How the Router Works

  When someone types ./august-qa "check if retag speakers is broken":

  1. The prompt goes to a fast Claude Haiku call (~0.1s, ~$0.001):
  Given AUGUST_CONTEXT.md and this user request: "check if retag speakers is
  broken"
  Which workflows should run? Return JSON: ["conversations"]
  Also return a focused instruction for the agent.
  2. Haiku returns: {"workflows": ["login", "conversations"], "focus": "Focus on
   the Retag Speakers feature in conversation detail view"}
  3. Only login + conversations workflows run, with the agent's prompt
  emphasizing retag speakers

  No args = all workflows. The router only activates when the user provides a
  natural language instruction.

  This means:
  - ./august-qa → runs all 6 workflows (full QA)
  - ./august-qa "test coaching" → runs login + overview (focused on coaching)
  - ./august-qa "full ux test" → runs all 6 (router understands "full")
  - ./august-qa "new feature on deals page" → runs login + crm_entities (focused
   on deals)

  Let me update the plan with this revised approach.

⏺ Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Let me rewrite the full plan with the revised zero-friction approach.

⏺ Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview

⏺ The plan is now completely revised with:

  1. Zero-friction UX — just ./august-qa, no flags, no .env files
  2. Natural language input — team types what they want to test in plain English
  3. Smart router — Haiku interprets the prompt and picks which workflows to run
  4. Interactive setup wizard — first run asks for credentials once, saves them
  forever
  5. Environment shortcuts — --dev, --staging, --local instead of URLs
  6. Extensible — add a workflow by creating one Python file and adding a line
  to config.yaml
