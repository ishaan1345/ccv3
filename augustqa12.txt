❯ please read literally all of the augustqa1-11. launch subagents to read   
  each file. you yourself should read 11 because thats where we were last   
  and thats where we were interrrupted.  do you understand me?              

⏺ Understood. I'll launch subagents to read augustQA 1-10 in parallel, and read
  11 myself. Let me first find all the files.

⏺ Searched for 1 pattern (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Found them. The files are spread across two locations - some in the root and
  some in august-qa/. Here are all 11:

  1. /Users/ishaan/ccv3/augustQA1.txt
  2. /Users/ishaan/ccv3/augustQA2.txt
  3. /Users/ishaan/ccv3/augustqa3.txt
  4. /Users/ishaan/ccv3/augustqa4.txt
  5. /Users/ishaan/ccv3/august-qa/augustqa5.txt
  6. /Users/ishaan/ccv3/augustqa6.txt
  7. /Users/ishaan/ccv3/augustqa7.txt
  8. /Users/ishaan/ccv3/augustqa8.txt

  10. /Users/ishaan/ccv3/august-qa/augustqa10.txt
  11. /Users/ishaan/ccv3/august-qa/augustqa11.txt

  Launching 10 subagents for files 1-10 and reading 11 myself now.

⏺ File 11 is huge (62k tokens). Let me read it in chunks while the subagents
  work.

⏺ Good, I've got the beginning - the plan and start of implementation. Let me
  continue reading the rest of file 11.

⏺ I've read all of file 11. The session ended with a context limit right when
  you were asking two critical things:

  1. Stop skipping HubSpot — you gave your creds (ishaan@helloaugust.com) and
  wanted it actually running
  2. Run a REAL report — you were tired of seeing mock data, wanted to run
  against live app.helloaugust.ai

  Let me now collect the summaries from all 10 subagents. Let me check which
  have finished.
